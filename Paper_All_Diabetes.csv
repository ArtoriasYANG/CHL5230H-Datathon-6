Title,Abstracts,Discussion
Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus: new criteria,"New recommendations for the classification and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus include the preferred use of the terms ""type 1"" and ""type 2"" instead of ""IDDM"" and ""NIDDM"" to designate the two major types of diabetes mellitus; simplification of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus to two abnormal fasting plasma determinations; and a lower cutoff for fasting plasma glucose (126 mg per dL [7 mmol per L] or higher) to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. These changes provide an easier and more reliable means of diagnosing persons at risk of complications from hyperglycemia. Currently, only one half of the people who have diabetes mellitus have been diagnosed. Screening for diabetes mellitus should begin at 45 years of age and should be repeated every three years in persons without risk factors, and should begin earlier and be repeated more often in those with risk factors. Risk factors include obesity, first-degree relatives with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia or previous evidence of impaired glucose homeostasis. Earlier detection of diabetes mellitus may lead to tighter control of blood glucose levels and a reduction in the severity of complications associated with this disease.","The changes recommended by the expert committee for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus should prove beneficial to patients. Measurement of fasting plasma glucose levels should be more acceptable to patients than the oral glucose tolerance test and can be readily incorporated with fasting lipid determinations. Identifying asymptomatic persons earlier in the disease process will allow earlier institution of lifestyle changes and medical therapy that may decrease the complications of hyperglycemia. The National Diabetes Data Group emphasizes that these changes in diagnostic criteria have not changed the treatment goals in patients with diabetes mellitus. These goals include maintaining a fasting plasma glucose level of less than 120 mg per dL (6.65 mmol per L) and a glucose hemoglobin measurement of less than 7.0 percent.

Diabetes mellitus,"Diabetes mellitus occurs commonly in the older patient and is frequently undiagnosed. In many cases, the initial manifestations of diabetes mellitus are lower extremity complications with which this disease is known to be associated. Unfortunately, these complications are similar to other age-related degenerative processes; therefore, vigilance for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is essential in the evaluation and treatment of lower extremity pathologic conditions.",
Treatment and Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus and Its Complication: Advanced Approaches,"Diabetes mellitus and its complications became epidemic and posses
serious challenge to the health care system. Sixth edition of IDF Atlas
predicted that 382 million people were suffering from Diabetes Mellitus in
2013 and the number will reach 592 million by 2035 worldwide. It was also
predicted that about 5.1 million deaths occurred due to diabetes and its
complications in 2013, health care spendings on diabetes has also reached to
USD 548 billion.
 Current therapeutic policies need to sharpen to avert the situation. Several
advance researches like natural and synthetic product research, rational drug
design, high-throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, computer aided
drug design, biomarker targeted therapy and structure-activity-relationship studies are going on, which have shown positive
indication to combat the epidemic situation related to diabetes mellitus and its complications.
 In this era, management and treatment of diabetes mellitus is a challenge to all researchers and healthcare personnel. A
number of new drugs like SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-IV inhibitors, GLP-1 analogue, dual PPAR α & γ agonists are in the market
along with conventional drugs like insulin, sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones etc. A number molecules like β3
adreno receptor agonist (SR-58611, TAK-677), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors (Safranal), Glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (CT 99021, CT 20026), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (human IL-1Ra, nanakinra), GSK5182 - an inverse agonist of
estrogen-related receptor γ have shown their antidiabetic potential in experimental studies and could be the future antidiabetic
drug.
 In experimental investigations, gene therapy through modification of non-insulin producing cell genetically to β cell,
genetical modification of islet cell, manipulate the β cell to stop autoimmune destruction of such cell had shown promising
effect. Approaches towards the pancreatic islet transplantation (islet auto-transplantation or islet allo-transplantation) and stem
cell therapy also hold the opportunity to become an answer for diabetes and its complications despite experimental up and
down in future. Diabetes vaccine is another new approach in this regard. Though, the clinical trial of two diabetes vaccine
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and Diapep277 has been discontinued after phase III trial, but current effect of GAD when
combined with other drugs in healthy children (with the high risk of developing T1DM) is in progress. But we feel it is need of
the hour to develop new strategies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications.
 In this special thematic issue, articles related to the advancement of new antidiabetic strategies/drugs are included. We hope
to provide an overview on the development in the field synthetic chemistry, clinical research, research on diabetic complication
or computer aided drug of design. Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common diabetic complication. Recent research has
focused to target voltage-gated sodium channels as a most compelling target for PDN treatment as this approach can increase
clinical efficacy, cost effectiveness, tolerability and targeted treatment strategy. α-glucosidase is located in the brush border of
small intestine and involve in the breakdown of starch and disaccharides to glucose. Inhibitors of α-glucosidase (like acarbose)
have immerged as potent oral anti-diabetic drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus act by preventing carbohydrates digestion. DFT
and docking studies on oleanolic acid and its oxidative metabolites (which are potential α-glucosidase inhibitors) could be
interesting to develop new antidiabetic drug. Synthetic chemistry always play a key role in diabetic research. A number of new
drugs are in the market or in development stage which surely will make a diference in averting diabetic epedemic. We are on
our way to develop new drug or stretegy but at the same time we also need to concentrate on the adverse effect, risk factor,
phathophisiological mechanism to confer best remedy to the patient suffering from diabetes mellitus and its complications.
Acute coronary syndrome is considered a risk factor and also a complication for asymptomatic diabetes mellitus. A careful
understanding of phathophisiological mechanism, proper clinical trail and analyzing the statistics related to drug and diseases
and framing proper guidelines are essential. ",
"Diabetes mellitus: an overview of the types, symptoms, complications and management","The incidence of diabetes mellitus is rapidly increasing, and this condition often results in significant metabolic disease and severe complications. Nurses have a crucial role in monitoring, educating and supporting people with diabetes, as well as their families and significant others. This article provides an overview of the main types and common symptoms of diabetes, its acute and long-term complications and its management. It also outlines the nurse's role in diabetes care, which frequently includes assessing and empowering patients.
",
Treatment Goals in Diabetes,"The quality of glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus relies on accurate individualization of available treatment options. Treatment targets depend on the type and duration of diabetes, the patients' abilities and characteristics and the individual risk for acute and/or late-stage complications. These complications include hypoglycaemia, which can be severe and life threatening, hyperglycaemia, which is a main factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, and macrovascular and microvascular disease, both of which are hallmark features of diabetes-associated constraints. Moreover, other treatment goals in diabetic patients influence both glycaemic control and quality of life. Lipoproteins, blood pressure, weight control, mental health and lifestyle are important factors that contribute to the frequency of diabetes-associated complications.",
Diabetes: a dynamic disease,"The distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes was
described as early as 500–600 BC by Indian physicians
Sushruta and Charaka—type 1 being associated with
onset in youth, and type 2 linked to obesity. Today,
diabetes is recognised as a complex and heterogeneous
disease that can affect people at different life stages.
As such, the classic phenotypes of age of onset and
metabolic features that once helped to define the types
of diabetes are now far less useful clinical indicators.
Modern appreciation of the heterogeneity of diabetes is
not simply a product of a deeper understanding of the
genetics, risk factors, and pathophysiology of the disease.
A constellation of changing lifestyles, technology, and
societal development has spurred an unprecedented
global
epidemic of diabetes over the past 40 years. This
epidemic has also driven emergence of new phenotypes,
in particular for type 2 diabetes, and a disturbing shift in
the demographics of affected populations.","A wealth of evidence demonstrates that the spectrum
of diabetes and its complications are highly varied across
disease types—and through the life course. Diagnosis
and management of diabetes are compounded by
the emergence of new phenotypes, particularly in
adolescents. As understanding of pathophysiology of
diabetes deepens, so too should the realisation that the
disease itself is evolving. Clinical management strategies
must rapidly adapt to meet the unique and dynamic needs
of each and every patient with diabetes"
Diabetes Mellitus at an Elderly Age,"Due to the good medical care in Germany, many people with diabetes mellitus now reach old age: Of the 340,000 adults with type 1 diabetes, more than 100,000 are over 70 years of age. Approximately 8 million people have type 2 diabetes and one-fourth of this group is over 75 years of age, and approximately 1 million over the age of 80 [1].

Nationwide, there are a total of about 630,000 people with diabetes mellitus in need of care. The statements in the practice recommendations are mainly directed at the majority of elderly people with type 2 diabetes and can only reflect some of the special characteristics of elderly people with diabetes. Topics such as type 1 diabetes at an elderly age, end of life, interface management or ethics are covered in the complete S2k guideline.

The geriatric patient is defined by multimorbidity and a higher age. Age-typical functional limitations and high vulnerability create a special need for action that goes beyond blood glucose control and the management of cardiovascular risk factors or diabetes-typical complications. For differentiated therapy planning, elderly patients should be divided into functional groups",
Diabetes mellitus in the pre-school child,"Diabetes mellitus presents rarely in the pre-school child and presents specific problems because of the peculiarity of the young child physiology. Pathogenesis involves the classic immunological mechanisms, with a higher incidence of other autoimmunity and family history of diabetes. Because of the rarity of the condition in this age group, the delay of the recognition of the signs and symptoms, which are often subtle at onset, determines the increased incidence of ketoacidosis. The reasons for the lower glycaemic control in this age group include the persistence of endogenous insulin, but also a more detailed involvement by the parents in organising diabetes. For the same reason ketoacidosis is an unusual occurrence after diagnosis. As to insulin therapy, three or more injections a day should be recommended, as in the older child, while the modern devices for blood glucose monitoring have proved useful to improve glycaemic control and to decrease the frequency of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which gives particular concern given the vulnerability of the nervous system in this age group. Management of diabetes in the pre-school child may result very difficult for both parents and health carers because of the erratic daily pattern of activity, sleep and feeding; however, with a cautious strategy which involves insulin therapy, diet and monitoring it is possible to achieve satisfactorily the following aims: physical well-being of the young child, normal growth, lack of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, acceptable value of glycosilated haemoglobin.",
Epidemiological Perspectives of Diabetes,"The global statistics of diabetes mellitus in year 2013 indicated, about 382 million people had this disease worldwide, with type 2 diabetes making up about 90 % of the cases. This is equal to 8.3 % of the adult population with equal rates in both women and men. In year 2012 and 2013 diabetes resulted in mortality of 1.5–5.1 million people per year, making it the 8th leading cause of death in the world. It is predicted that by year 2035 about 592 million people will die of diabetes. The economic cost of diabetes seems to have increased worldwide. An average age of onset of diabetes is 42.5 years and could be due to consumption of high sugar and high-calorie diet, low physical activity, genetic susceptibility, and lifestyle. Approximately 8 % children and about 26 % young adults have diabetes mellitus in the world. The results of epidemiological study of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) are presented by demographic, geographic, biologic, cultural, and other factors in human populations. The prevalence of T1D has been increased by 2–5 % worldwide and its prevalence is approximately one in 300 in US by 18 years of age. The epidemiological studies are important to study the role, causes, clinical care, prevention, and treatment of type1 diabetes in pregnant women and their children before and after birth. In this article, causes, diagnosis, symptoms, treatment and medications, and epidemiology of diabetes will be described.","The three types of diabetes, symptoms and its prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management of diet, diabetes in pregnancy, epidemiology of diabetes, and medications of diabetes are mentioned above. Prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing in the world and more in women as compared to men. The children are also affected with diabetes. Controlling sugar levels in the blood is necessary by insulin injections or by treatment with various known medications for diabetes mellitus. The diabetic children show symptoms of dehydration, persistent vomiting, metabolic derangement, or serious inter-current illness which require proper management and intravenous rehydration. There are several known drugs available in the market for the diabetes care such as Invokana, Metformin, Diastix strips, Insulin injections, and other medications. The fatty diet, more sugar, no exercise, poor lifestyle, smoking, alcoholism, and other factors are responsible for the causes of diabetes mellitus. The blood sugar levels must be controlled in diabetic people."
Diabetes in Africans. Part 2: Ketosis-prone atypical diabetes mellitus,"Diabetes is increasing with ageing and changes in lifestyle in populations of African ancestry as described in the first part of this review. Apart from classical type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, atypical presentations are observed in these populations, especially ""tropical"" and ""ketosis-prone"" atypical diabetes. Ketosis-prone atypical diabetes that has been classified by ADA as idiopathic Type 1 diabetes or Type 1b is the most common atypical form. It is characterised by an acute initial presentation with severe hyperglycaemia and ketosis, as classical Type 1 diabetes. In the subsequent clinical course after initiation of insulin therapy, prolonged remission is often possible with cessation of insulin therapy and maintenance of appropriate metabolic control. Metabolic studies showed a markedly blunted insulin secretory response to glucose, partially reversible with the improvement of blood glucose control. Variable levels of insulin resistance are observed, especially in obese patients. Pancreatic B-cell autoimmunity is an exceptional finding. Association with type 1 susceptibility HLA alleles is variable. The molecular mechanisms underlining the insulin secretory dysfunction are still to be understood and may involve gluco-lipotoxicity processes, glucagon dysregulation, effect of stress, or may be genetically determined. The present review summarises the available clinical and metabolic features and suggests some pathogenetic hypotheses and principles of management for the ketosis-prone atypical diabetes of the Africans.",
Clinical impact of posttransplant diabetes mellitus,"POSTTRANSPLANTdiabetesmellitus (PTDM) is a fearedcomplicationof immunosuppression that has longbeenrecognizedasafactorcontributingtoincreased riskofgraft lossandposttransplantmorbidityandmortality.1,2Aswill bediscussed, it is likely, as is thecase for patientswithpreexistent type1or type2diabetes, that patientswithPTDMareat increasedriskforthedevelopment of themicrovascular complications of diabetes, includingneuropathy,nephropathy, andretinopathy.

Diabetes in children,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is one of the common disorders affecting sodium and water homeostasis, and results when ADH is either inadequately produced, or unable to negotiate its actions on the renal collecting tubules through aquaporins. The diagnostic algorithm starts with exclusion of other causes of polyuria and establishing low urine osmolality in the presence of high serum osmolality. In this paper, we have reviewed the diagnosis, etiology and management of DI in children, with special emphasis on recent advances in the field.",
Applying the WHO global targets for diabetes mellitus,"In 2022, the WHO created the first global targets for diabetes mellitus. The targets are that by 2030, 80% of people living with diabetes mellitus are diagnosed, and that 80% of those living with diabetes mellitus will have good control of glycaemia and blood pressure, 60% of those >40 years old will be receiving statins and 100% of those with type 1 diabetes mellitus will have access to affordable insulin and self-monitoring of blood levels of glucose. In this article, experts from around the globe discuss how these targets could be achieved.",
The definition and classification of diabetes mellitus,"Definition of Diabetes Mellitus
Diabetes mellitus is the collective term for heterogeneous metabolic disorders whose main finding is chronic hyperglycaemia. The cause is either a disturbed insulin secretion or a disturbed insulin effect or usually both.

* The team of authors has written the practical recommendation for the Commission for Laboratory Diagnostics in Diabetology/Kommission Labordiagnostik in der Diabetologie of the German Diabetes Society/Deutsche Diabetes Gesellschaft (DDG) and the German Society for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (DGKL)/ Deutschen Gesellschaft für Klinische Chemie und Laboratoriumsmedizin.
","For some time now, attempts have been made to more precisely classify type 2 diabetes, which presents itself as a very heterogeneous group. Based on large Scandinavian studies, L. Groop and his research group have proposed to divide type 2 diabetes into 4 subgroups (clusters) using age at diabetes diagnosis, BMI and the laboratory parameters HbA1c, GAD autoantibodies, C-peptide and HOMA-B or HOMA-R. The aim of this project is to develop a new type of diabetes management system for the treatment of diabetes. This new classification also defines subgroups which, for example, have a high probability of suffering from diabetic retinopathy (cluster 2) or diabetic nephropathy (cluster 3) [9]. The authors point out that the new classification can also lead to therapy optimisation. Since this new subclassification was also verified in cohorts of other countries, it could also be put into practice in the future.

Recently, in a large prospective study of the German Diabetes Study Group, a heterogeneous group of people with diabetes was subjected to extensive phenotyping at the time of diagnosis and followed up for 5 years [10]. It was possible to discover clusters with specific risk patterns, especially with regard to the development of polyneuropathy and NAFLD. This is another milestone in the subclassification of people with type 2 diabetes.

After much preliminary work by A. Ziegler's research group in Munich in cooperation with international centres, it was shown that with the presence of several autoantibodies against β- cell peptides in early childhood, the probability of manifestation of type 1 diabetes within 15 years is very high (high predictive value) [7]. If the pilot therapy studies already underway are positive, general screening for risk markers in early childhood could be introduced across the board [11]."

","The nomenclature of human diabetes mellitus (DM) has been revised, and this classification has been accepted throughout the medical world and literature. The major categories of diabetes are: insulin-dependent DM, type I or IDDM; noninsulin-dependent DM, type II or NIDDM; secondary DM or type S; impaired glucose tolerance, IGT; gestational diabetes; and previous abnormality of glucose tolerance, PrevAGT. A review of the literature has shown that over half of the documented diabetic dogs, with a single medical diagnosis, appear to be type I, IDDM, with a substantial proportion being type S, and the remainder being type II, NIDDM. Obesity is frequently associated with IGT and NIDDM. Diabetic cats most commonly have pancreatic islet destruction associated with pancreatic amyloidosis; they are insulin deficient, IDDM. The commonest causes of secondary diabetes in dogs are pancreatic damage, hyperadrenocorticism and hypersomatotropism secondary to persistent progesterone influence. Progestogen therapy is the most frequently reported cause of secondary diabetes in cats. Diabetes in horses is type S, usually secondary to a functional pituitary tumor but occasionally following chronic pancreatitis. The blood glucose ranges for normal, IGT and diabetic animals, and the normal serum insulin values of various species is tabulated.",

Depression in diabetic patients: the relationship between mood and glycemic control,"Abstract
Problem
Evidence from prospective and cross-sectional studies demonstrates that the presence of diabetes doubles the risk of comorbid depression. This commonly overlooked comorbidity affects more than one quarter of the diabetic population, making its recognition and treatment in diabetic patients clinically relevant.

Methods
PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE databases were searched (search words: diabetes, depression, metabolic control, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia) for articles that evaluated outcomes, relationships, and/or management of comorbid depression and diabetes published between 1980 and 2002. This review represents a synthesis of the findings including treatment recommendations.

Results
Concurrent depression is associated with a decrease in metabolic control, poor adherence to medication and diet regimens, a reduction in quality of life, and an increase in health care expenditures. In turn, poor metabolic control may exacerbate depression and diminish response to antidepressant regimens. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are effective in the presence of diabetes; both cognitive behavior therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are weight neutral and have been associated with glycemic improvement in some studies.

Conclusion
Depression is common in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and has significant effects on the course and outcome of this medical illness. Conventional antidepressant management strategies are effective and the regimen should be tailored to the individual patient. Enhanced efforts toward good glycemic control may also contribute to improvements in mood and perceptions of well-being.","The appropriate management of any chronic medical illness, including diabetes, should include the identification and treatment of comorbid depression. This approach considers the major effects of affective illness on symptom burden, functional impairment, quality of life, and self-management of the primary disease. Among patients with diabetes, more than one quarter has depression at a clinically significant level. Despite this, depression is recognized and treated in only about one third of

Longitudinal progression of diabetes mellitus in Wolfram syndrome: The Washington University Wolfram Research Clinic experience,"1) Describe the progression of diabetes mellitus over time in an observational study of Wolfram syndrome, a rare, genetic, neurodegenerative disorder which often includes diabetes mellitus and is typically diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. 2) Determine whether C-peptide could be used as a marker of diabetes progression in interventional trials for Wolfram syndrome.

Methods:
N=44 (25F/19M) participants with genetically-confirmed Wolfram syndrome attended the Washington University Wolfram Research Clinic annually from 2010–2019. Medical history, physical examinations, blood sampling, and questionnaires were used to collect data about diabetes mellitus and other components of Wolfram syndrome. Beta-cell function was assessed by determination of C-peptide during a mixed meal tolerance test. Random coefficients models evaluated the rate of progression of C-peptide over time, and power analyses were used to estimate the number of subjects needed to detect a change in C-peptide decline during an intervention trial.

Results:
93.2% of patients had diabetes mellitus. Mean HbA1c across all study visits was 7.9%. C-peptide significantly decreased with increasing duration of diabetes mellitus (p<0.0001); an optimal break point in C-peptide decline was identified to occur between 0.1 and 2.3 years after diabetes mellitus diagnosis. Twenty patients per group (active vs. control) were estimated to be needed to detect a 60% slowing of C-peptide decline during the first 2.3 years following diabetes diagnosis.

Conclusion:
C-peptide declines over time in Wolfram syndrome and could potentially be used as a marker of diabetes progression in interventional studies for Wolfram syndrome, especially within the first 2 years after diabetes diagnosis.","This study first aimed to describe the course of diabetes mellitus in Wolfram syndrome. A large majority of our sample with Wolfram syndrome had diabetes mellitus (93.2%), with an average HbA1c of 7.9%. C-peptide clearly declined in patients with Wolfram syndrome with an optimal break point in decline between 0.1 and 2.3 years after diabetes diagnosis. However, interestingly, there was no clear statistically significant plateau at which C-peptide no longer changed after reaching an optimal breakpoint (i.e., C-peptide continued to decline). This is in contrast to type 1 diabetes mellitus populations described in the literature, which have been shown to have an exponential fall in C-peptide measured via urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR) over 7 years followed by a stable plateau in C-peptide levels28. Thus, C-peptide could potentially decline more rapidly in Wolfram syndrome patients, but residual beta-cell function may persist longer than in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus; however, given the different methodologies used between studies, future research is needed to directly compare C-peptide decline in Wolfram syndrome and type 1 diabetes using identical methodology.

The current study also aimed to determine if beta-cell function could be used as a marker of diabetes progression in patients with Wolfram syndrome. Power analyses estimated that in subjects beginning an intervention trial within 2.3 years of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, a sample size of only 30–20 per group would be needed to detect a 50%−60% slowing in the rate of C-peptide decline. A total of n=14 (34%) participants with both Wolfram syndrome and diabetes mellitus in the current sample had a diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome within 2.3 years of a diabetes mellitus diagnosis.

Given these results, there are numerous considerations to be made when considering beta-cell function as a marker of disease progression in interventional trials for Wolfram syndrome. First, lower differences in the rate of C-peptide decline may also be meaningful and more feasible (e.g., 25% slowing); however, it would require more subjects which may be challenging given the rarity of the syndrome. The recruitment challenges for an interventional trial using beta-cell function also highlight the crucial importance of collaborative efforts across national and international centers that have expertise with Wolfram syndrome. However, the sample size required for C-peptide is much more feasible than those calculated for other Wolfram syndrome manifestations such as hearing loss, which was shown to require 75 subjects with sensorineural hearing loss to detect a 50% slowing7. Third, the results highlight the importance of early diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome. Not only would early diagnosis help in using beta-cell function as a marker of diabetes progression, but early diagnosis of monogenetic forms of diabetes could help families and health care teams develop treatment and support plans tailored to improve quality of life for the patient. Thus, endocrinologists should further evaluate youth with autoimmune negative diabetes to determine any underlying causes that might require a unique treatment plan for the patient (e.g., skills training programs for those with vision or hearing loss). Lastly, it is important to note that even if an intervention slows the progression of diabetes, it may or may not be relevant for the more devastating neurological features of Wolfram syndrome.

There are study limitations to be considered. The sample size was limited given the rarity of the disease. In addition, it is likely that many patients with Wolfram syndrome may not manifest other features of the syndrome for years after the initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and, therefore, may not be diagnosed with Wolfram syndrome until after the first few years of diabetes mellitus (e.g., only n=8 in the current sample were recruited within 2.3 years after diabetes mellitus diagnosis). Second, the inclusion criteria may also have biased the sample given that subjects had to have the resources and ability to travel to Washington University in St. Louis for participation. The sample also includes a younger population given that early-onset subjects were specifically recruited for the clinic to increase the likelihood of a more detectable progression and description of the natural history of Wolfram syndrome over time; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to older populations. It should be noted that the median age of onset of diabetes mellitus in our cohort was 5–6 years old and there was minimal C-peptide remaining after 8–10 years of diabetes mellitus; thus, few adults with Wolfram syndrome will still have adequate C-peptide to use as a marker in a clinical trial. Lastly, given that the current study only measured HbA1c once annually at the clinic, a comprehensive measure of cumulative glycemic exposure over time could not be obtained and could potentially be a determinant of the rate of C-peptide decline.

Overall, the current study suggests that beta-cell function could potentially be a useful marker of progression if restricted to Wolfram syndrome subjects early in the course of diabetes mellitus. This could have important implications for Wolfram syndrome as researchers seek to develop novel pharmacological treatments to improve or slow the progression of the condition.

Review of current status of molecular diagnosis and characterization of monogenic diabetes mellitus: a focus on next-generation sequencing,"Introduction: Monogenic diabetes is a subset of diabetes characterized by the presence of single-gene mutations and includes neonatal diabetes mellitus and maturity-onset diabetes of the young. Due to the genetic etiology of monogenic diabetes, molecular genetic testing can be used for diagnosis and classification.Areas covered: In addition to first-generation molecular analyses, many large clinical laboratories are transitioning to multiplexed next-generation sequencing panels to simultaneously assess patients for several of the most common genetic mutations seen in monogenic diabetes. With expanded development and adoption of next-generation sequencing panels, particularly in reference to laboratory settings, diagnostic testing for monogenic diabetes has the potential to be more accessible to the patient population.Expert opinion: Although molecular diagnostic testing is becoming increasingly prevalent, it is crucial to identify patients most likely to benefit from molecular testing versus those whose disease can be diagnosed and characterized with more traditional, less costly laboratory analyses. The continuous evolution of clinical molecular testing will be echoed in the clinical laboratory analysis of monogenic diabetes and continue to improve the diagnostic capabilities for monogenic diabetes mellitus.","Although they will likely become increasingly prevalent and offers a multitude of benefits, the use of molecular-based assays for the diagnosis of monogenic diabetes mellitus does present drawbacks and is not suitable in all circumstances. While an increasing number of clinical laboratories are adopting molecular-based tests, many are still unequipped to develop and/or implement molecular assays. Many hospital clinical laboratories lack the background or expertise in molecular diagnostics to effectively implement, optimize, and troubleshoot molecular assays. Additionally, molecular testing can be cost-prohibitive to both the clinical laboratory and the patient population. The use of molecular-based assays raises an array of ethical concerns, as well, such as reporting variants of unknown significance and incidental findings, in addition to the repercussions for family members who may be impacted by results.

Next-generation sequencing in particular presents a unique set of challenges within the realm of molecular diagnostics. One of the most glaring hurdles specific to NGS is the complex and resource-intensive development process. Oftentimes, extensive support from vendors and instrument manufacturers, as well as copious collaboration with a bioinformatics department, is essential from development through implementation and optimization of the assay(s). For the time-being, NGS-based assays are more common in reference laboratories and larger hospital systems. It is likely that NGS-based assays for MDM will be send-out tests for the majority of clinical laboratories. Building awareness and educating clinicians on the availability, utility, and interpretation of test results are other considerations in the overall picture of NGS testing for MDM. With many new mutations causing MDM being identified, it will be important to educate physicians on how to proceed if they still suspect the patient has MDM.

A critical consideration when testing for suspected cases of MDM is whether molecular assays should be first-line tests or reserved for cases with less typical clinical presentations. A study conducted in a diabetes outpatient clinic utilized an online MODY probability calculator and demonstrated sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 64%, positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 93% [Citation3]. These results would support the preliminary use of online MODY probability calculating tools for patients with suspected MODY to guide subsequent laboratory testing. Shield and colleagues have recommended the use of non-molecular testing to first rule out type 1 DM since it is far more common than MDM and can have a similar clinical presentation. C-peptide and islet autoantibodies were recommended as first-line tests to rule out type 1 DM at a relatively low cost in comparison to molecular assays. If indicated by the results of the aforementioned tests, molecular analyses could follow [Citation5].

Another consideration regarding molecular testing for MDM is the appropriate molecular-based methodology to employ. While NGS-based panels are useful, their comprehensive nature may not be necessary for all cases. For example, if a patient’s phenotype strongly suggests a mutation in a particular gene(s), targeted testing for specific mutations by Sanger sequencing may be the most cost- and time-effective option. When NGS-based testing is employed, a decision must be made whether to use a targeted panel or whole exome sequencing. Typically, it is wise to start with targeted-panel NGS and only move to whole exome sequencing when the results of targeted panels do not reveal a mutation [Citation71]. A tradeoff in coverage exists when going from targeted NGS panels to whole exome sequencing. It is also important to note that short of whole genome sequencing, mutations in introns, regulatory regions, and even large copy number alterations may not be identified in some panels [Citation4]. In general, the author believes that targeted NGS panels are oftentimes the most appropriate molecular method for the detection of mutations contributing to MDM, so long as sufficient bioinformatics support is available for development.

Despite the plethora of complexities and considerations regarding the use of molecular-based analyses, they clearly present a diagnostic advantage for suspected cases of MDM. Furthermore, several laboratories in the US and abroad have already developed and are optimizing the use of NGS technologies to multiplex panels for a more complete and rapid genetic analysis of these patients. In the next several years, I believe the landscape of laboratory assays used for the characterization and diagnosis of MDM will be dominated by a set of large, multiplexed, NGS-based panels.

Gestational Diabetes: Diagnosis, Classification, and Clinical Care","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 6% of pregnant women, and prevalence is increasing in parallel with the obesity epidemic. Protocols for screening/diagnosing GDM are controversial with several guidelines available. Treatment of GDM results in a reduction in the incidence of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and macrosomia. If diet and lifestyle changes do not result in target glucose levels, then treatment with metformin, glyburide, or insulin should begin. It is generally recommended that pregnancies complicated by GDM do not go beyond term. For women identified to have prediabetes, intensive lifestyle intervention and metformin have been shown to prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes.
","GDM and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in pregnancy are growing public health concerns related to the rise in obesity. To minimize complications to the mother and child, diagnosing and managing GDM is critical. However, the ideal screening, diagnostic testing, and management for GDM remains debated. Future randomized controlled trials need to address whether adopting stricter guidelines will improve pregnancy outcomes and what the optimal diet and treatments should be for women with GDM. Postpartum screening and long-term monitoring for diabetes is equally important given the increased risk for conversion to type 2 diabetes over time in those who have had GDM. Lifestyle intervention and metformin significantly reduce progression to type 2 diabetes in these women."

Falls risk in older adults with type 2 diabetes,"Falls are a major health issue for older adults, especially for those who develop type 2 diabetes who must contend with age-related declines in balance, muscle strength, and walking ability. They must also contend with health-related issues specific to the disease process. Given the general association between these variables and falls, being able to identify which measures negatively impact on balance in older diabetic persons is a critical step. Moreover, designing specific interventions to target these physiologic functions underlying balance and gait control will produce the greatest benefit for reducing falls in older persons with diabetes.","Falls are a major health issue for older adults, especially for those who develop type 2 diabetes who must contend with both age-related declines in balance, muscle strength, and walking ability7, 8, 16, 17, 18 and health-related issues specific to disease process, including neuropathy, retinopathy, poor glycemic control, electrolyte imbalance, polypharmacy, visual/vestibular problems, cognitive impairment, proprioceptive changes, hypotension, and pain.

Diabetes in the elderly. A unique set of management challenges,"The overall goals in regard to management of diabetes in the elderly are twofold. First, blood glucose control should be kept as near normal as possible (certainly always less than 200 mg/dl) without inordinately increasing risks related to therapy; this will decrease the risk of acute complications and hopefully of long-term ones as well. Second, overall functional status should be maintained or improved. Although a number of factors peculiar to old age complicate the management of diabetes, with careful planning these goals should be attainable.","The overall goals in regard to management of diabetes in the elderly are twofold.

Insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction as therapeutic targets in type 2 diabetes,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic levels in many parts of the world[1]. Strategies to reverse this trend and to ameliorate the burgeoning impact of type 2 diabetes must be based on a sound appreciation of the factors which initiate and promote the development of this complex disorder[2]. It is generally accepted that type 2 diabetes reflects a combination of: (1) resistance to the actions of insulin[3] in target tissues (often exacerbated by obesity); and (2) defective endogenous insulin secretion[2–4]. Since these defects are usually present in combination the task of establishing which is the primary abnormality has proved challenging even when studies are focused on the precursor, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)[5]. To complicate matters the contributions from each defect may vary between ethnic groups[1] as well as within individuals according to the stage at which studies are performed. There are also grounds to believe that limitations of methodologies and failure to match for important variables such as obesity may have influenced current views of the aetiology of type 2 diabetes.","Uncertainty surrounding the primacy of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction continues to stimulate debate. This controversy holds potentially important implications for the development of public health strategies for the prevention of type 2 diabetes − much of it obesity-related. Ongoing studies may help to clarify what has, to date, been a confusing picture[68]. Insulin secretagogues and insulin-sensitizers have established therapeutic roles in the pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes yet their capacity to provide good long-term glycaemic control is limited. Novel strategies for the pharmacological management of obesity are of obvious relevance to many patients with type 2 diabetes. However, we must acknowledge the considerable lacunae in knowledge concerning the optimal application of existing, yet alone new, therapies. Finally, the safety of new agents must remain an issue of prime concern, particularly with the drive to develop and introduce new drugs as rapidly as possible[69].

We may conclude that there are grounds for cautious optimism[70] about the future management of type 2 diabetes albeit tempered with concerns about long-term efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions. An era of unprecedented activity in the search for new antidiabetic agents has begun. Careful and adequate evaluation of each new drug is required. However, it seems unlikely that clinical trials of the magnitude of the UKPDS will be seen again in the near future. As ever, clinicians must proceed on the basis of incomplete information weighing up benefits and risks (and financial considerations) in the interests of their patients. Further insights of the aetiology of type 2 diabetes will hopefully continue to spur the development of improved therapeutic strategies."
[Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus--what to look out for],"Screening for diabetes makes good sense in particular in patients with overweight, hypertension or dyslipidemia. For type 2 diabetes is often not recognized until sequelae have put in an appearance. Consideration must be given to the possible presence of neuropathy, micro- and macroangiopathy and cardiovascular and cerebral disease. The primary therapy recommendations for type 2 diabetics comprise diet, weight loss and increased exercise. Depending on the success of these measures and the patient's constitution, medication with biguanides, sulfonylureas, glinides, glitazones alpha-glucosidase inhibitors or, where indicated, insulin, is then applied.",
Pharmacological treatment of diabetes in older people,"The pharmacological management of diabetes in older people is complex and challenging. It requires a comprehensive understanding of the individual beyond the diabetes itself. Through the ageing years, the older individual presents with diabetes-related and non-related comorbidities and complications, develops functional limitations and psychological issues, and may lack social support and access to care. A disturbance in these categories, known as the four geriatric domains, will negatively affect diabetes self-management and self-efficacy, leading to poor outcomes and complications. Furthermore, older people with diabetes may be more interested in the management of other chronic conditions such as pain or impaired mobility, and diabetes may be lower in their list of priorities. Proper education must be provided to the older individual and caregivers, with continuous monitoring and counselling, especially when pharmacological interventions offer risks of side effects, adverse reactions and interactions with other medications. Informed shared medical decisions will help to improve adherence to the regimen; however, such discussions ought to be based on the best evidence available, which is unfortunately limited in this age group. We performed a review focused on pharmacological agents and summarize current evidence on their use for the treatment of diabetes in older people. We encourage clinicians to investigate and incorporate the four geriatrics domains in the selection and monitoring of these agents.","Diabetes is a complex disease that progresses over time. In parallel, the individual ages and acquires comorbidities and complications related and non-related to the diabetes. The response to some pharmacological agents will not be as effective or applicable as it is in younger people with a shorter duration of disease. Moreover, chronic conditions and end-organ damage will affect glucose targets and limit the utilization of certain agents; thus, a comprehensive assessment of the individual as a whole is required before addressing the pharmacological management of diabetes. To follow up on the clinical stages described in the introduction, specific recommendations for each stage produce the following comments.
People who have just converted from prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose) to diabetes, who have a few comorbidities and remain physically active and with excellent cognitive status. Metformin remains the first choice for most people in this category, but several agents can be considered, and additional therapies should be implemented to achieve targets, according to the established guidelines for management 3, 17 and a patient-centered approach 6, 98. The regimen could be upgraded according to the guidelines and could incorporate oral and non-insulin injectable agents.
Individuals with recently detected diabetes but with complications at diagnosis (potentially related to ongoing chronic hyperglycaemia). Unless they have other major non-diabetes related comorbidities, people in this category mostly have preserved physical and cognitive function, and pharmacological interventions can be incorporated according to their personalized HbA1c target, medical access, insurance, costs and preference.
Individuals who developed diabetes in middle age, who over time acquired diabetes-related comorbidities and chronic complications. Several first-line medications may no longer be an option for people in this category because of contraindications. However, safer agents may have limitations in gastrointestinal tolerability or their actual efficacy in lowering HbA1c levels to the desired target. In individuals with end-organ damage (kidney, liver), insulin is the mainstay therapy of choice. In this setting, we avoid combination with other agents that, if added to insulin, may confuse the insulin titration process while increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, polypharmacy and costs.
Individuals with diabetes who are frail, with progressing cognitive impairment, multiple comorbidities and complications leading to disability. Both the clinician and the older individual/family should share careful understanding of the changing balance between benefits and harms, and the lesser impact from “tight” glucose control toward the prevention of diabetes-related complications. An average morning fasting glucose between 140 and 180 mg/dl [7.8 – 10 mmol/l] followed by random values below 200 mg/dl [11.1 mmol/l] during the rest of the day, will be consistent with an HbA1c of ∼8% [63.9 mmol/mol]. In this stage, it is paramount to avoid hypoglycaemic events as well as “low normal” glucose values, due to the increased risk to develop a true low value.
Individuals with diabetes unable to take care of themselves (therefore in nursing home settings) or those receiving end-of-life care. We concur with the recommendations made by the American Diabetes Association/American Geriatrics Society consensus 3, and for most patients in this stage, the main objective is to prevent hyperglycaemia leading to diabetic polyuria and other hyperglycaemic complications such as volume depletion and non-ketotic hyperosmolar state. The geriatric setting (assisted living facility, nursing home, hospice unit, etc.), availability of resources and costs, intensity of monitoring, potential adverse reactions and individual/family preferences should be considered when addressing the pharmacologic and monitoring approach. As an example, for an older individual considered to have a life-expectancy of less than one year, who lives in a nursing home, a regimen with insulin 70/30 twice per day will not be perfect, but may be efficacious in limiting hyperglycaemia, when compared with a basal-bolus regimen. The latter not only requires more expensive agents, but also increased nursing costs and time due to more frequent monitoring and medication administration. In all cases, even a lenient and carefully implemented regimen should always be accompanied by nursing home staff education in the prevention of hypoglycaemic events.
Glucose control must be individualized, weighed against safety concerns, and followed closely. Periodic adjustment of the goals and regimen must occur not only as the diabetes progresses, but also according to the level of functional impairment, cognitive decline and decreased life expectancy. The pharmacological management of diabetes in older people can be more demanding than in their younger counterparts, and we can expect to see greater numbers of older people with diabetes requiring specialized management. In Table 1, we suggest the pharmacological agents for the management of diabetes at different geriatric stages. Note that, in all cases shown, the individual has the same chronological age but presents with progressive complexity, and the options for management become narrower. The following recommendations will complement the selection process of pharmacological interventions in older people."
Cultural and religious influences in diabetes care in Great Britain,"Type 2 diabetes is four times more common in people originating from the Indian subcontinent (Asians) than in white English Caucasians. British Asians with diabetes have been shown to have poorer blood glucose control, awareness of diabetes management, and knowledge of complications. This review examines some of the dietary customs that can affect glucose control, problems with communication and diabetic education, and a brief description of health beliefs commonly held by Asian patients that may help the physician understand why some patients appear to show poor compliance with accepted Western medicine. Patients must always be approached as individuals with their own unique needs within the context of their cultural backgrounds.",
Diabetes care and education in rural regions,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine what is cur- rently known about diabetes education and care in rural geographical regions. Residents of rural areas are less likely to have access to health care providers, health insurance, or specialty care and are more likely to experience health care disparities as a result. Persons living in rural areas are likely to have greater burdens of chronic disease, including uncontrolled diabetes, and perceive their health as poorer than their urban counterparts.
Methods A conventional literature review focused on type 1 and type 2 diabetes was completed using the search terms rural, diabetes, and education. The databases searched were CINAHL, EBSCO, Pub Med, and Medline. In all, 22 research articles that fit the inclusion criteria were identified.
Results Findings indicated that diabetes education for rural regions can be enhanced by a focus on family, culture, interdisciplinary teams, and technology.","Conclusions Future rural research about diabetes care should carefully define rural, include gender-related studies that describe findings in terms of men and women, and focus on primary prevention."
A Clinical Update on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) traditionally refers to abnormal glucose tolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM has long been associated with obstetric and neonatal complications primarily relating to higher infant birthweight and is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for future maternal and offspring cardiometabolic disease. The prevalence of GDM continues to rise internationally due to epidemiological factors including the increase in background rates of obesity in women of reproductive age and rising maternal age and the implementation of the revised International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups' criteria and diagnostic procedures for GDM. The current lack of international consensus for the diagnosis of GDM reflects its complex historical evolution and pragmatic antenatal resource considerations given GDM is now 1 of the most common complications of pregnancy. Regardless, the contemporary clinical approach to GDM should be informed not only by its short-term complications but also by its longer term prognosis. Recent data demonstrate the effect of early in utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia, with evidence for fetal overgrowth present prior to the traditional diagnosis of GDM from 24 weeks' gestation, as well as the durable adverse impact of maternal hyperglycemia on child and adolescent metabolism. The major contribution of GDM to the global epidemic of intergenerational cardiometabolic disease highlights the importance of identifying GDM as an early risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, broadening the prevailing clinical approach to address longer term maternal and offspring complications following a diagnosis of GDM.","GDM is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and is increasing in global prevalence. Diagnosing GDM is important because perinatal complications and stillbirth risk are reduced by treatment. Despite the benefit of identifying and treating GDM, much of the current (short-term) diagnostic and management approach to GDM remains contentious. These differences confound interpretation and application of trial data, preventing a single standard international approach to GDM.

Recent data indicates near normal birthweight and maternity population outcomes in women with GDM based on modern IADPSG criteria in developed countries, demonstrating that even treatment of “milder” maternal hyperglycemia improves pregnancy outcomes. However, most cases of GDM occur in low- and middle-income countries where perinatal risks are far greater and universal 1-step testing may be more practical. There are limited RCT data to guide diagnosis and management in this setting, and further evidence is urgently needed. In developed countries including the United Kingdom, the main issue arguably does not pertain to women diagnosed with GDM but rather high-risk women who remain unscreened (associated with factors such as lower socioeconomic status and higher BMI) who are at highest risk of stillbirth (74).

The background to the various GDM diagnostic criteria is informative in demonstrating that no approach clearly separates risk groups. It is also now evident that a continuum of risk for GDM exists based on both the timing and degree of maternal hyperglycemia. This underscores the difficulty of defining absolute glucose thresholds at a single timepoint in pregnancy for the diagnosis of GDM and is confounded further by variation in glucose measurement due to preanalytical glucose processing and reproducibility issues. Thus, current diagnostic glucose thresholds for GDM must inevitably reflect compromise and consensus.

A precision medicine approach that recognizes GDM subtype and heterogeneity, enhanced by further research into the genetics of GDM and validation of novel biomarkers and new technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring may improve risk stratification, optimize clinical models of care, and facilitate more individualized and consumer-friendly detection and treatment strategies.

The recent HAPO-FUS data confirming the long-term impact of maternal hyperglycemia on maternal and offspring metabolic health (227,262) highlight an important paradigm shift. The approach to GDM should reflect an evidence base that evaluates diagnostic glucose thresholds and measurement within a framework that includes timing of detection and treatment trials with long-term clinical and health economic outcomes. For example, if the ongoing Treatment of Booking Gestational Diabetes Mellitus trial demonstrates a benefit for early GDM detection and treatment, there are implications for the prevailing diagnostic GDM glucose thresholds in later pregnancy. This is because these thresholds were derived from the risk of perinatal complications in a heterogeneous GDM cohort, which included women who would fulfill early GDM criteria.

Other important areas for research include the evaluation of dietary interventions establishing the optimal carbohydrate threshold in GDM, further clarity on the potential long-term impact of intrauterine metformin on the offspring, as well as the efficacy of preconception and early pregnancy preventive strategies targeting risk factors other than glycemia, such as maternal obesity and GWG. Improved obstetric assessment of placental function, especially in late pregnancy, to inform timing of delivery and identify women at highest risk of stillbirth in GDM is also needed.

The complications of GDM may indeed be greater based on the severity of maternal glycemia and associated vascular risk factors. Nevertheless, the traditional focus on diagnostic criteria and short-term antenatal maternal glucose management fails to address the importance of identifying “milder” (IADPSG-defined) GDM as a risk factor for future maternal and offspring diabetes and CVD risk. It should also be apparent that the increasing prevalence of GDM largely reflects the worsening metabolic health burden including prediabetes and obesity in women of childbearing age. The clinical focus for GDM must therefore urgently shift to early postnatal prevention strategies to decrease the progression from GDM to type 2 diabetes and address longer term maternal and offspring cardiometabolic risk post-GDM via a life course management approach."
Does screening for gestational diabetes mellitus make a difference?,"Ever since the introduction of the concept of gestational diabetes mellitus, there has been controversy about the importance of this condition and the appropriateness of screening for it. Societies and associations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,1 the American Diabetes Association (ADA),2 the Canadian Diabetes Association3 and the Fourth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus4 have recommended either universal or selective screening. These recommendations are based on the premise that identification and treatment of gestational diabetes will avert some of the adverse outcomes that have been associated with this condition, such as pregnancy- induced hypertension, macrosomia (potentially associated with fetal birth trauma), perinatal mortality and neonatal metabolic disorders.5,6,7,8,9 Other bodies, such as the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination10 and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada,11 have taken a more cautious approach, noting that there is insufficient scientific data to suggest that identification and treatment of gestational diabetes result in better maternal and neonatal outcomes. Indeed, there is evidence that identification of gestational diabetes may result in unfavourable maternal outcomes.12 Hunter and Keirse,13 in their contribution to Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth, concluded that “except for research purposes all forms of glucose tolerance testing should be stopped.” Thus, it is important that studies be conducted to determine whether identification and treatment of gestational diabetes is associated with improvement in maternal and neonatal outcomes.
","This study underscores the controversy at the heart of the debate over the importance, or even the existence, of gestational diabetes. Some physicians in Canada do not believe that this condition exists, and others feel that its importance is so low that screening is not justified.11 Many researchers, in studies like this one, are trying to shed light on this subject,9,17,18 but the controversy will only end once a robust, randomized, double-blind trial is conducted to demonstrate whether identification and management of gestational diabetes is associated with significant improvement in neonatal or maternal outcome. Unfortunately, no such study is yet under way.

While waiting for the results of such a trial, it would be reasonable to follow the SOGC guidelines published in November 200211 (see Box 1)."
"
Frailty in elderly diabetes patients","Frailty is a state of vulnerability and a consequence of cumulative decline in multiple physiological systems over a lifespan. The occurrence of frailty depends on deterioration in muscle and nerve function, declining cardiopulmonary reserve and loss of executive function. Diabetes mellitus (DM) often causes functional impairment in each of the above systems, thus leading to a loss of whole body homeostasis and deterioration in physical function. Inability of self-management in DM patients may also have considerable impact on the development of sarcopenia/frailty. Thus, there may be positive feedback between the progression of diabetic complications and frailty/sarcopenia. While various factors are involved in this process, insulin resistance or insulin depletion may be an important factor in the progression of frailty in diabetes patients since insulin is well known to be an anabolic hormone in muscle. Interestingly, in our study targeting elderly DM patients, low HbA1c was a significant and independent risk factor for frailty, as assessed using a broad sense frailty scale, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CSF), suggesting that reverse metabolism due to malnutrition in elderly type 2 DM patients might be involved. Therefore, an intervention that includes proper nutrition and exercise training may be essential for the prevention of frailty. The pathogenesis of frailty in DM patients is extensively discussed in this review.","While recent studies in elderly type 2 DM patients have shown a J-shaped or U-shaped relationship of HbA1c with frailty, only low HbA1c is associated with frailty in our study. This difference may be due to the type of frailty scale used, i.e. a narrowly defined (physical based) scale or a broadly defined scale. Nevertheless, strict glycemic control for some elderly DM patients may cause a poor prognosis for mortality, cardiovascular events, dementia and frailty because of malnutrition, hypoglycemia and other unknown mechanisms."
Obesity and type 2 diabetes,"The increasing prevalence of obesity is accompanied by an increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes but also compounds its health risks and complicates its management. The health benefits of weight loss and the efficacy of current weight loss strategies in obese persons with type 2 diabetes are evaluated. In addition, the article reviews the results of lifestyle intervention trials designed to reduce conversion to type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals.",The dual epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes present serious public health challenges. The results of the diabetes prevention trials reviewed previously indicate that lifestyle interventions that promote weight loss and increased physical activity may be effective in reducing the progression to type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals. The potential morbidity and mortality consequences of the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes clearly warrant additional research into how the benefits achieved in lifestyle intervention trials may be sustained and how the diet and activity interventions used may be implemented in the general population.
The clinical consequences of heterogeneity within and between different diabetes types,"Advances in molecular methods and the ability to share large population-based datasets are uncovering heterogeneity within diabetes types, and some commonalities between types. Within type 1 diabetes, endotypes have been discovered based on demographic (e.g. age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity), genetic, immunological, histopathological, metabolic and/or clinical course characteristics, with implications for disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In type 2 diabetes, the relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction are heterogeneous and relate to demographics, genetics and clinical characteristics, with substantial interaction from environmental exposures. Investigators have proposed approaches that vary from simple to complex in combining these data to identify type 2 diabetes clusters relevant to prognosis and treatment. Advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics are also improving treatment. Monogenic diabetes is a prime example of how understanding heterogeneity within diabetes types can lead to precision medicine, since phenotype and treatment are affected by which gene is mutated. Heterogeneity also blurs the classic distinctions between diabetes types, and has led to the definition of additional categories, such as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, type 1.5 diabetes and ketosis-prone diabetes. Furthermore, monogenic diabetes shares many features with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which make diagnosis difficult. These challenges to the current classification framework in adult and paediatric diabetes require new approaches. The 'palette model' and the 'threshold hypothesis' can be combined to help explain the heterogeneity within and between diabetes types. Leveraging such approaches for therapeutic benefit will be an important next step for precision medicine in diabetes. Graphical abstract.","Two different approaches may help explain the heterogeneity within and between diabetes types. The palette model proposes that multiple pathophysiological processes contributing to diabetes risk and progression, with variable relative importance in each individual, determine the phenotype and could be leveraged for therapy [56]. The threshold hypothesis contends that clinical diabetes develops when the combined influences of genetic and environmental diabetogenic factors exceeds a threshold [57]. These two models can be combined to understand the joint effect and interactions between multiple factors with variable contribution to diabetes risk in different individuals (Fig. 3). This perspective supports the search for endotypes (e.g. within type 1 diabetes) that elucidate heterogeneity within diabetes types. It also helps explain heterogeneity between diabetes types and downplays the need to classify diabetes types into distinct categories. Leveraging the knowledge on disease heterogeneity for therapeutic purposes will be an important next step for the advancement of precision medicine in diabetes.

Results &#114 - &#114 The majority of patients were given the diagnosis of HF mainly as a result of clinical examination, ECG and chest X-ray, or of hospitalisation for HF. The diagnosis of HF by the primary care physicians was based on an objective evaluation of cardiac function in 8% of the patients. Hypertension was the predominant associated disease, followed by ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Therapy included diuretics (91%), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (43%) and digoxin (53%). Conclusion &#114 - &#114 There is still a gap between current management of HF in primary care and guidelines, particularly in the case of diagnosis that is not generally based on an objective evaluation of cardiac function.",
Impact of computer simulation on diabetes research and practice,"Diabetes is usually delineated by a simple measurement—the blood glucose concentration. The simplicity of this diagnosis belies a complex disease that involves many organ systems and can be affected by various internal and environmental factors. In treating diabetes, clinicians must consider all of these factors simultaneously and then prescribe therapies that may involve insulin, sulfonylureas, and life-style adaptations to minimize hyperglycemia while avoiding hypoglycemia. Because of the complexity of blood glucose regulation, it is clearly a great art to balance all factors that affect blood glucose and optimize diabetes therapy. Like many arts, the management of diabetes may require years to master and may be difficult to teach to others. Objective methods for analyzing factors that regulate blood glucose should facilitate the implementation and teaching of diabetes management by transforming the art into a series of objective, well-defined, and reproducible rules. Mathematics has long been used to predict the behavior of complex systems when human intuition is inadequate or too imprecise for the task. The availability of the computer has greatly increased our ability to make such predictions. Everyone is aware of the use of digital computers to predict the weather, the path of rockets and the future course of the economy. It seems logical that physicians should use the computer to predict the course of blood glucose, particularly as a function of specific therapies that they have in hand. Yet, the proportion of clinicians who use this technology is virtually nil. Why?","Mathematical analysis of complex systems with computer technology has revolutionized many aspects of biologic science. The application of this technology to the clinical care of diabetic patients is still in its infancy but holds great promise as a tool for understanding problems that are too complex for solution by human intuition and clinical experience alone. The continued development of models, such as that of Berger and Rodbard, and the testing and application of those models in clinical settings may revolutionize our ability to regulate blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes."

Although no differences with regard to fracture healing and subsequent functional results in later years could be established in patient put on the correct diet and insulin dose, as compared to the control group, the clinical complication rate and the mortality rate were significantly higher among patients of old age with Diabetes mellitus. To bring about a possible change, operating techniques providing the possibility of an early mobilisation and optimal physiotherapeutical after--care are recommended.",
"The dietary inflammatory index, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors and diseases","An unhealthy diet is a recognized risk factor in the pathophysiology of numerous chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCD), including obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This is, at least in part, due to unhealthy diets causing chronic low-grade inflammation in the gut and systemically. To characterize the inflammatory potential of diet, we developed the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®). Following this development, around 500 papers have been published, which examined the association between the DII, energy-adjusted DII (E-DII™), and the children's DII (C-DII™) and many chronic NCDs including obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. Although a previous narrative review published in 2019 briefly summarized the evidence in this area, there was a significant increase in papers on this topic since 2020. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review is to provide an in-depth updated review by including all papers until July 2021 on DII and its relationship with obesity, T2DM, and CVD. Furthermore, we aim to identify potential gaps in the literature and provide future directions for research. Most studies found that DII was associated with an increased risk of obesity, T2DM, and CVD with some relationships being sex-specific. However, we identified the paucity of papers describing associations between dietary inflammation and T2DM and its risk factors. Few studies used gold-standard measures of cardiometabolic risk factors. We also identified the lack of interventional studies designed to change the inflammatory potential of diets and study its effect on cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases. We recommend that such interventional studies are needed to assess if changes in DII, representing the inflammatory potential of diet, independently of changes in body composition can modulate cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases.","Evidence from this review suggests that DII scores corresponding to a pro-inflammatory diet are associated with an increased risk of obesity, T2DM, and CVD. Other adapted DII versions such as the C-DII and E-DII also were positively associated with risk of both childhood and adult obesity including visceral obesity. It would be important to design studies where a change in DII was a primary intervention with energy intake maintained to understand the impact of an anti-inflammatory diet independent of energy intake on cardiometabolic parameters.

Practical tools for assessing the inflammatory potential of diet may be useful in clinical and community settings. However, given that most of these studies were observational and unable to confirm causality, RCTs studying the effect of changing DII are needed before DII can be recommended as a tool for reducing obesity, T2DM, and CVD."
Classification and Diagnosis of Diabetes: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes-2022,"The American Diabetes Association (ADA) ""Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes"" includes the ADA's current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, a multidisciplinary expert committee (https://doi.org/10.2337/dc22-SPPC), are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for ADA's clinical practice recommendations, please refer to the Standards of Care Introduction (https://doi.org/10.2337/dc22-SINT). Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.
","The conflicting recommendations from expert groups underscore the fact that there are data to support each strategy. A cost-benefit estimation comparing the two strategies concluded that the one-step approach is cost-effective only if patients with GDM receive postdelivery counseling and care to prevent type 2 diabetes (247). The decision of which strategy to implement must therefore be made based on the relative values placed on factors that have yet to be measured (e.g., willingness to change practice based on correlation studies rather than intervention trial results, available infrastructure, and importance of cost considerations).

As the IADPSG criteria (“one-step strategy”) have been adopted internationally, further evidence has emerged to support improved pregnancy outcomes with cost savings (248), and IADPSG may be the preferred approach. Data comparing populationwide outcomes with one-step versus two-step approaches have been inconsistent to date (234,249–251). In addition, pregnancies complicated by GDM per the IADPSG criteria, but not recognized as such, have outcomes comparable to pregnancies with diagnosed GDM by the more stringent two-step criteria (252,253). There remains strong consensus that establishing a uniform approach to diagnosing GDM will benefit patients, caregivers, and policy makers. Longer-term outcome studies are currently underway.

Pregnancy and complicated diabetes,Contemporary management of the insulin-dependent pregnant diabetic is associated with perinatal outcome little different from that in the non-diabetic. Diabetic microangiopathy and its consequences continue to pose a significant threat to the welfare of the diabetic mother and her baby. Pregnancies thus complicated require specialized care by an experienced team.,
"SEE-diabetes, a patient-centered diabetes self-management education and support for older adults: Findings and information needs from providers' perspectives","Abstract
Background and aims
Diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) can improve clinical and health outcomes of people with diabetes. However, DSMES has been underutilized because of many barriers. We aimed to develop a patient-centered educational aid, SEE-Diabetes (Support-Engage-Empower-Diabetes), that facilitates shared decision-making about DSMES between patient and provider during the follow-up visit. We investigated the information needs to inform the design of the SEE-Diabetes from the providers’ perspective.

Methods
We conducted an online survey (N = 42) and three focus groups (N = 13) involving providers who have experience managing diabetes in older patients. Survey collected demographics and assessed knowledge of DSMES. During the subsequent focus groups, participants evaluated the Assessment and Plan section of three clinic notes of older people with diabetes. We also demonstrated the potential workflow of DSMES documentation using SEE-Diabetes during clinical practice.

Results
The survey showed 60% of providers were familiar with DSMES. Focus group findings showed clinic notes should convey concise information at an appropriate reading level, numbered problems, and less medical jargon to improve the readability of clinic notes. Application of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals was suggested to deliver effective diabetes self-care information.

Conclusions
Providers should consider adopting validated DSMES guidelines along with goal-setting strategies to provide patient-centered care. The research team will integrate the provider recommendations when we develop SEE-Diabetes.","Our study findings revealed that about 60% of providers were familiar with DSMES, and 36% of providers were familiar with ADCES7 Self-Care Behaviors. Our providers at the University of Missouri Health Care had a higher percentage of knowledge of DSMES when compared with previous studies. In 2010, Ruppert et al. examined DSMES referrals from primary care physicians in a rural community. The study reported that only 24% of type 2 diabetes patients were referred to DSMES program despite providers’ "
Multifactorial aspects of the treatment of the type II diabetic patient,"Abstract
People with type II diabetes have a twofold to fourfold increased risk of dying from the complications of cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis and vascular thrombosis are major contributors. The increased risk is present before fasting hyperglycemia is seen. These individuals often have a sedentary life-style, poor physical conditioning, insulin resistance, centripetal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a prothrombotic state. Chronic hyperglycemia is then added to these risk markers. Microalbuminuria may precede hyperglycemia in type II diabetes, occurs in 30% to 40% of these individuals after diabetes is established, and is a predictor of cardiovascular events. Early intervention in high-risk individuals may delay or prevent fasting hyperglycemia. An all-inclusive approach that focuses on early risk factor (or marker) identification and management to prevent or delay accelerated atherosclerosis and thrombosis in type II diabetes is an attractive strategy. However, the database to support this strategy is limited. In particular, large-scale prospective trial data are not available to support the concept of intensive glycemic regulation to prevent progression of macrovascular disease in type II diabetes. This is in contrast to the situation regarding microvascular disease of the eyes and kidneys. Recently, indirect data of a correlative nature have emerged, and short- and long-term prospective trials at early and late stages of type II diabetes are now being reported. These studies are analyzed and interpreted in this report. In contrast, the database to support an intensive antiplatelet regimen to prevent vascular thrombotic events in people with type II diabetes is large, and these studies are reviewed. They are of a type and magnitude to allow definite recommendations for aspirin therapy in type II diabetes. Aggressive therapy directed at hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and elevated urinary albumin in people with type II diabetes appears to be indicated. Increased attention to the multifactorial aspects of treatment of the type II diabetic patient is needed. Our present challenge is to translate these findings for patients and primary health care providers so that effective actions may be implemented.",
World Diabetes Day--a global event for children,"As pediatric endocrinologists, we know that with appropriate medical care and access to medications, technology, education, and support, the children we care for with diabetes can thrive and live productive, healthy lives. But this is not the case for thousands of children around the world. In many developing countries, children succumb to the ravages of diabetes because they do not have access to these basic components of care. For example, in Mali, children live, on average, 12 months after they are diagnosed. Worldwide, many children do not even receive insulin. To combat this, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has established the “Life for a Child” program, which provides insulin, clinical care, glucose testing equipment, and education to about 1000 children and families in Rwanda, the Congo, Tanzania, Nigeria, Bolivia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Uzbekistan, Mail, Zimbabwe, and Azerbaijan. The IDF is working to double the size and scope of this program over the next year by asking health care providers to mobilize the diabetes community in support of Life for A Child (www.lifeforachild.org)","On World Diabetes Day, November 14, 2008, the IDF will focus the world on a simple message—No Child Should Die of Diabetes. By raising awareness about the plight of children, their susceptibility to DKA, and the Life for a Child program, World Diabetes Day 2008 gives us the chance to demand that children have early detection of diabetes, improved access to and delivery of care, sufficient diabetes supplies, medications and technology, and better self-management education and training. If this can be accomplished, this generation of children burdened with diabetes, and those that follow, will grow to be healthy members of the world community."
Management of diabetes in elderly patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: current and future perspectives,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire population with the most deleterious effects in elders. Elders, especially those with diabetes, are at the highest risk of COVID-19 related adverse outcomes and mortality. This is usually linked to the comorbidities that accumulate with age, diabetes-related chronic inflammation, and the pandemic's psychosocial effects.","Expert opinion: The COVID-19 pandemic has lifted the veil off serious deficiencies in the infrastructures for care at both the individual level and the population level and also highlighted some of the strengths, all of which affect individuals with diabetes and COVID-19. We anticipate that things will not return to 'normal' after the COVID-19 pandemic has run its course, but rather they will be superseded by 'New Normal.'"
"American Diabetes Association Annual Meeting, 1999: more on cardiovascular disease","This is the final report on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions held in San Diego, California, in June 1999. It covers topics related to cardiovascular disease, carotid atherosclerosis, and the relationship between type 2 diabetes and inflammation.","In a related study at the ADA Annual Meeting, De Luis et al. (abstract 1112) reported that 22 patients with type 1 diabetes and Helicobacter pylori infection showed increases in HDL and decreases in lipoprotein(a) levels after treatment with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole. These effects were not observed in patients whose infection was not cured. Krebs et al. (abstract 130) infused triglyceride emulsion and heparin to increase FFA levels from 265 to 3,010 µmol/l in healthy male subjects. PAI-1 levels increased 2.6fold, which could potentially trigger impaired fibrinolysis in diabetes. Zheng et al. (abstract 184) measured PAI-1 levels in 411 patients from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial follow-up cohort, showing a 27% increase in patients with vs. without hypertension, regardless of age, sex, HbA1c value, albuminuria, or obesity. Hunter et al. (abstract 599) reported an increase in fibrinogen levels in patients with nephropathy from the same population. Herlihy et al. (abstract 547) compared siblings of patients with type 2 diabetes whose fasting blood glucose levels were 108 and between 108 and 139 mg/dl. PAI-1 levels were 2.4-fold higher in the hyperglycemic group and were correlated with insulin resistance. Pucci et al. (abstract 660) and Yoshioka et al. (abstract 662) studied type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Patients homozygous for the 4G allele of the PAI-1 gene promoter, which is associated with decreased fibrinolysis, had an increased prevalence of proliferative retinopathy. Friday et al. (abstract 882) reported that postmenopausal women with diabetes treated with conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg daily for 8 weeks showed a decrease in PAI-1 levels, which could potentially decrease atherosclerosis."
The prediabetic state: a concept of dynamic resistance to a genetic diabetogenic influence,"We have reviewed current considerations and technics involved in attempts at earlier diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. It is concluded that the standardized glucose tolerance test is the most sensitive diagnostic index. The cortisone-glucose tolerance test must still be regarded as being in the investigative stage, although it appears to be emerging as a test capable of detecting beta cell fatigue earlier than it is detected by the standard glucose tolerance test.
A search for parameters of study other than carbohydrate metabolism which could detect the “diabetic trait” before beta cell decompensation occurs is regarded as the most fertile field for future research in connection with earlier detection and ultimate prevention of the diabetes syndrome. The high incidence of fetal complications of pregnancy in women destined to become diabetic many years later supports the existence of an active metabolic aberration long before the insulogenic mechanism becomes overwhelmed.
A concept of a dynamic diabetogenic period existing from the time of birth until beta cell decompensation occurs is presented. It is likely that ultimately we will divide manifestations of the diabetes syndrome into those which precede and those which follow the onset of hypoinsulinism; and the latter group into those which are and those which are not dependent upon insufficient activity of insulin. Such a concept is consistent with the evolution of the various clinical manifestations of the disease.
Finally, we admit that we have taken full advantage of this opportunity to speculate about many aspects of the “diabetes syndrome,” one end stage of which expresses itself as hypoinsulinism.",
WHO diagnostic criteria as a validation tool for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus: a study in five European countries,"Objective: In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) published new diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus (DM). The cut-off value of the fasting plasma glucose concentration was lowered from 7.8 to 7.0 mmol/l. The WHO criteria were used to validate the diagnosis made by the general practitioner, and to compare the diagnostic validity of diabetes mellitus in different countries. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 2556 newly diagnosed diabetics. Incidence was calculated according to the 1999 WHO criteria. Data were collected in general practice networks in five European countries or regions (Belgium, England, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain). Results: According to the WHO criteria, 82% of the cases were valid diagnoses. Compared to the total group, in Spain, significantly more diagnoses were in agreement with the WHO criteria, whereas this number was significantly lower in England and Portugal. From the patients whose diagnosis was not in agreement with the WHO criteria, significantly more were women than men.
","By using the WHO diagnostic criteria, the international standard, as a validation tool, we show that the diagnoses of diabetes mellitus made in primary care are valid. Furthermore, we show that these diagnoses are comparable between countries. Therefore, information from general practice registration networks is a valuable and valid source for international comparisons."
Improving pregnancy outcomes in women with diabetes mellitus: modern management,"Women with pre-existing (type 1 or type 2) diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of pregnancy complications, such as congenital malformations, preeclampsia and preterm delivery, compared with women who do not have diabetes mellitus. Approximately half of pregnancies in women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus are complicated by fetal overgrowth, which results in infants who are overweight at birth and at risk of birth trauma and, later in life, the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Strict glycaemic control with appropriate diet, use of insulin and, if necessary, antihypertensive treatment is the cornerstone of diabetes mellitus management to prevent pregnancy complications. New technology for managing diabetes mellitus is evolving and is changing the management of these conditions in pregnancy. For instance, in Europe, most women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus are treated with insulin analogues before and during pregnancy. Furthermore, many women are on insulin pumps during pregnancy, and the use of continuous glucose monitoring is becoming more frequent. In addition, smartphone application technology is a promising educational tool for pregnant women with diabetes mellitus and their caregivers. This Review covers how modern diabetes mellitus management with appropriate diet, insulin and antihypertensive treatment in patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus can contribute to reducing the risk of pregnancy complications such as congenital malformations, fetal overgrowth, preeclampsia and preterm delivery.
","The cornerstones of modern diabetes mellitus management in pregnancy are appropriate diet and insulin therapy with a focus on prevention of maternal hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications.

Implementing an appropriate diet with a focus on the quantity and quality of carbohydrates and limiting maternal gestational weight gain are promising treatment areas to reduce the risk of fetal overgrowth.

The use of insulin analogues, insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring and bolus calculators might help improve glycaemic control and reduce the risk of severe maternal hypoglycaemia in pregnancy.

Early and intensive antihypertensive treatment with antihypertensive agents approved for use in pregnancy might reduce the risk of preeclampsia and preterm delivery, especially in women with diabetic kidney disease.

Easily accessible patient education (that is, via smartphone application technology) is useful to reach pregnant women and provide information on modern diabetes mellitus management to improve pregnancy outcomes."
Editorial: Modern Management and Monitoring of Childhood Diabetes,"Incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes in youth are increasing worldwide, while the disease prevention progress slower than hoped. It is estimated that the incidence of type 1 diabetes among children and adolescents under the age of 15 years increase around 3% with strong geographic differences. Therefore, the management and monitoring of childhood diabetes play a central role in clinical practice, which cannot simply derive from the knowledge gained from the management of adults with diabetes. Epidemiology, diagnosis and therapy, as well as implications on growth and impact on the family, require specific pediatric management.

The purpose of this Research Topic is to provide an update on modern diabetes management and monitoring in young people, focusing on prediction, epidemiology, treatment, technology and complications.","A recently proposed biological marker for chronic complications of diabetes is the Klotho protein. It is a transmembrane protein also present in a soluble form in the blood, mainly present in human brain, kidney, vascular tissue and other endocrine organs. The KLOTHO gene was identified as an ageing suppressor gene that extends life span when overexpressed and accelerates ageing when disrupted. Zubkiewicz-Kucharska et al. studied the serum concentration of Klotho in children with diabetes, reporting its possible involvement in the development of chronic complications."
Artificial Intelligence: The Future for Diabetes Care,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing field and its applications to diabetes, a global pandemic, can reform the approach to diagnosis and management of this chronic condition. Principles of machine learning have been used to build algorithms to support predictive models for the risk of developing diabetes or its consequent complications. Digital therapeutics have proven to be an established intervention for lifestyle therapy in the management of diabetes. Patients are increasingly being empowered for self-management of diabetes, and both patients and health care professionals are benefitting from clinical decision support. AI allows a continuous and burden-free remote monitoring of the patient's symptoms and biomarkers. Further, social media and online communities enhance patient engagement in diabetes care. Technical advances have helped to optimize resource use in diabetes. Together, these intelligent technical reforms have produced better glycemic control with reductions in fasting and postprandial glucose levels, glucose excursions, and glycosylated hemoglobin. AI will introduce a paradigm shift in diabetes care from conventional management strategies to building targeted data-driven precision care.",
Precision prognostics for the development of complications in diabetes,"Individuals with diabetes face higher risks for macro- and microvascular complications than their non-diabetic counterparts. The concept of precision medicine in diabetes aims to optimise treatment decisions for individual patients to reduce the risk of major diabetic complications, including cardiovascular outcomes, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and overall mortality. In this context, prognostic models can be used to estimate an individual’s risk for relevant complications based on individual risk profiles. This review aims to place the concept of prediction modelling into the context of precision prognostics. As opposed to identification of diabetes subsets, the development of prediction models, including the selection of predictors based on their longitudinal association with the outcome of interest and their discriminatory ability, allows estimation of an individual’s absolute risk of complications. As a consequence, such models provide information about potential patient subgroups and their treatment needs. This review provides insight into the methodological issues specifically related to the development and validation of prediction models for diabetes complications. We summarise existing prediction models for macro- and microvascular complications, commonly included predictors, and examples of available validation studies. The review also discusses the potential of non-classical risk markers and omics-based predictors. Finally, it gives insight into the requirements and challenges related to the clinical applications and implementation of developed predictions models to optimise medical decision making.","Although an increasing number of prognostic models have been developed and validated to predict diabetes complications, the concept of precision prognosis as a component of precision medicine is still in its infancy. Epidemiological and clinical research could inform its further development"
Progress in genetics of type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications,"Type 2 diabetes results from a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Precision medicine for type 2 diabetes using genetic data is expected to predict the risk of developing diabetes and complications and to predict the effects of medications and life-style intervention more accurately for individuals. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in European and Asian populations and new genetic loci have been identified that modulate the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Novel loci were discovered by GWAS in diabetic complications with increasing sample sizes. Large-scale genome-wide association analysis and polygenic risk scores using biobank information is making it possible to predict the development of type 2 diabetes. In the ADVANCE clinical trial of type 2 diabetes, a multi-polygenic risk score was useful to predict diabetic complications and their response to treatment. Proteomics and metabolomics studies have been conducted and have revealed the associations between type 2 diabetes and inflammatory signals and amino acid synthesis. Using multi-omics analysis, comprehensive molecular mechanisms have been elucidated to guide the development of targeted therapy for type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications.","Many genetic loci related to diabetes and diabetic complications have been discovered, and it is expected that the mechanism of disease onset will be elucidated and its implementation in medical care will progress by utilizing the polygenic risk score and multi‐omics analysis. For this challenge to succeed and sustain, it is important to communicate with society. 118 Ethical considerations should be addressed so that participants’ right to know and not know are adequately protected, and genomic research is truly beneficial."
Establishment and Validation of a Risk Prediction Model for Early Diabetic Kidney Disease Based on a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 20 Cohorts,"Background: Identifying patients at high risk of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) helps improve clinical outcome. Purpose: To establish a model for predicting DKD.Data sources: The derivation cohort was from a meta-analysis. The validation cohort was from a Chinese cohort.Study selection: Cohort studies that reported risk factors of DKD with their corresponding risk ratios (RRs) in patients with type 2 diabetes were selected. All patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) <30 mg/g at baseline.Data extraction: Risk factors and their corresponding RRs were extracted. Only risk factors with statistical significance were included in our DKD risk prediction model.Data synthesis: Twenty cohorts including 41,271 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in our meta-analysis. Age, BMI, smoking, diabetic retinopathy, hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, UACR, and eGFR were statistically significant. All these risk factors were included in the model except eGFR because of the significant heterogeneity among studies. All risk factors were scored according to their weightings, and the highest score was 37.0. The model was validated in an external cohort with a median follow-up of 2.9 years. A cutoff value of 16 was selected with a sensitivity of 0.847 and a specificity of 0.677.Limitations: There was huge heterogeneity among studies involving eGFR. More evidence is needed to power it as a risk factor of DKD.Conclusions: The DKD risk prediction model consisting of nine risk factors established in this study is a simple tool for detecting patients at high risk of DKD.","Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis, we developed a simple risk prediction model for early DKD that integrates lifestyle and clinical risk factors, including age, BMI, smoking, DR, HbA1c, SBP, HDL-C, TG, and UACR. We validated the model in an external cohort, showing that the model is important for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention of DKD."
Machine Learning for Predicting the Risk of Transition from Prediabetes to Diabetes,"Traditional risk scores for the prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are typically designed for a general population and, thus, may underperform for people with prediabetes. In this study, we developed machine learning (ML) models predicting the risk of T2D that are specifically tailored to people with prediabetes. We analyzed data of 13,943 individuals with prediabetes, and built a ML model to predict the risk of transition from prediabetes to T2D, integrating information about demographics, biomarkers, medications, and comorbidities defined by disease codes. Additionally, we developed a simplified ML model with only eight predictors, which can be easily integrated into clinical practice. For a forecast horizon of 5 years, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.753 for our full ML model (79 predictors) and 0.752 for the simplified model. Our ML models allow for an early identification of people with prediabetes who are at risk of developing T2D.",
Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Based on Machine Learning Algorithm,"Prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) occurrence allows a person at risk to take actions that can prevent onset or delay the progression of the disease. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict T2D occurrence in the following year (Y + 1) using variables in the current year (Y). The dataset for this study was collected at a private medical institute as electronic health records from 2013 to 2018. To construct the prediction model, key features were first selected using ANOVA tests, chi-squared tests, and recursive feature elimination methods. The resultant features were fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, triglycerides, BMI, gamma-GTP, age, uric acid, sex, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and family history. We then employed logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, and ensemble machine learning algorithms based on these variables to predict the outcome as normal (non-diabetic), prediabetes, or diabetes. Based on the experimental results, the performance of the prediction model proved to be reasonably good at forecasting the occurrence of T2D in the Korean population. The model can provide clinicians and patients with valuable predictive information on the likelihood of developing T2D. The cross-validation (CV) results showed that the ensemble models had a superior performance to that of the single models. The CV performance of the prediction models was improved by incorporating more medical history from the dataset.","In this paper, we proposed a T2D occurrence prediction model that can forecast the occurrence of T2D in the following year (Y + 1) as normal, prediabetes, or diabetes. LR, RF, XGBoost, SVM, and ensemble classifiers (CIM, ST, and SV) were utilized to generate the prediction models. Feature selection was employed to select the most significant features that can distinguish the three classes efficiently. The selected features were FPG, HbA1c, triglycerides, BMI, gamma-GTP, gender, age, uric acid, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and family history. Experimental results showed that the performance of the generated prediction model was reasonably good at forecasting the incidence of T2D in the Korean population. The model can provide both clinicians and patients with valuable information on the incidence of T2D ahead of time, which would help patients take measures to mitigate T2D risk, progression, and related complications. Furthermore, it can be used as a viable support in clinical decision-making for practitioners and diabetes educators to improve the quality of life of patients."
The validation of cardiovascular risk scores for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,Objective: Various cardiovascular prediction models have been developed for patients with type 2 diabetes. Their predictive performance in new patients is mostly not investigated. This study aims to quantify the predictive performance of all cardiovascular prediction models developed specifically for diabetes patients.,"All 10 evaluated models had a comparable and moderate discriminative ability. The recalibrated, but not the original, prediction models provided accurate risk estimates. These models can assist clinicians in identifying type 2 diabetes patients who are at low or high risk of developing CVD."
German Diabetes Risk Score for the Determination of the Individual Type 2 Diabetes Risk,"Background: The German Diabetes Risk Score (GDRS) currently enables prediction of the individual risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) within five years. The aim of this study is to extend the prediction period of the GDRS, including its non-clinical version and its HbA1c extension, to 10 years, and to perform external validation.","The extended GDRS prediction period of 10 years, with a non-clinical version and an HbA1c extension that will soon be available in both German and English, enables the even longer-range, evidence-based identification of high-risk individuals with many different applications, including medical screening."
Association of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the risk of colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis and systematic review,"Aim: To provide a quantitative assessment of the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods: Systematic review was conducted thorough MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of knowledge databases till 31(st) January 2014. This meta-analysis included the cohort studies that illustrated relative risk (RR) or odds ratio estimates with 95%CI for the predictive risk of CRC by T2DM. Summary relative risks with 95%CI were analyzed by using an effects summary ratio model. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by the Cochran's Q and I (2) statistics.
Results: The meta analysis of 8 finally selected studies showed a positive correlation of T2DM with the risk of CRC as depicted by effects summary RR of 1.21 (95%CI: 1.02-1.42). Diabetic women showed greater risk of developing CRC as their effect summary RR of 1.22 (95%CI: 1.01-49) with significant overall Z test at 5% level of significance was higher than the effect summary RR of 1.17 (95%CI: 1.00-1.37) of men showing insignificant Z test. The effect summary RR of 1.19 with 95%CI of 1.07-1.33 indicate a positive relationship between DM and increased risk of CRC with significant heterogeneity (I (2) = 92% and P-value < 0.05).",Results from this systematic review and meta-analysis report that diabetic people have an increased risk of CRC as compared to non-diabetics.
Development of a nomogram for predicting the risk of left ventricular diastolic function in subjects with type-2 diabetes mellitus,Development of a nomogram for predicting the risk of left ventricular diastolic function in subjects with type-2 diabetes mellitus,"In 2009, the first set of guidelines for echocardiographic evaluation of LVDD was published by ASE (American Society of Echocardiography) and EACVI (European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging)13. More revently in 2016, diastolic dysfunction ASE guidelines was updated factoring in several echocardiographic characteristics to diagnose and stage LVDD in an elegant fashion [14]. In previous trials, it has been showed that EAT thickness is associated with LVDD in metabolic syndrome patients [5]. To our knowledge, this is the first research to construct a simple-to-use nomogram which predicts the risk of LVDD in subjects with T2DM. The developed nomogram using data from the LASSO) logistic regression incorporates 4 items, EAT, SBP, Tol.chol, LDL, and RVAW. This novel nomogram could be applied into the outpatient setting to conduct a rapid assessment of LVDD risk in patients with T2DM. The extensive use of this nomogram in T2DM patients could potentially avoid excessive medical inspection, thereby lightening the burden on family's financial.

In this study, it was found that EAT mass was greater in subjects with T2DM, especial in LVDD group, which was consistent with previous studies [19–21]. The result indicated that EAT thickness is correlated with the E/A index in subjects with E/A ≥ 1. EAT is component of the visceral adipose tissue with both systemic and local effects around the heart. Leonetti confirmed that EAT thickness on echocardiography was found higher in subjects with more than one clinical and metabolic characteristics of Metabolic syndrome than those healthy [19]. A positive linear correlation was reported between EAT thickness and several parameters such as glucose and LDL cholesterol, especially fasting insulin [19, 22]. Our experimental results also found that some parameters have statistical association with EAT, such as HDL and fasting insulin.

In 2003, Iacobellis et al. [15] firstly proposed the echocardiography for EAT measurement. Echocardiography boasted unique advantages over computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is cheap and easily obtained, accompanied by high repeatability and fast application in clinical work. The research reported significant correlation with EAT and several clinical features, such as waist circumference, intracardiac fat and intra-abdominal fat [19, 23]. The amelioration of statistical modeling have induced the progress of nomograms to assess obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) risk depended on clinical features, demographic characteristics and somatometric measurement. Xu et al. [24] reported a nomogram which contained 8 independent factors (sex, age, glucose, insulin, apolipoprotein B, BMI, waist circumference and neck circumference) constructed by a LASSO regression method, that and predicted non-, moderate-to-severe and severe OSA accuracy. However, no questionnaires have been constructed for the purpose of identifying patients at high risk of LVDD prioritize potential treatment.

Since large amounts of subjects with T2DM encountered by endocrinologists, opening a window of opportunity to screen T2DM subjects on endocrinology wards for associated comorbidities, including LVDD, and when necessary, make appropriate interventions. In this study, the nomogram performed as a screening tool to identify T2DM patients at risk of LVDD, as demonstrated by AUC values > 0.6. To reduce overfitting, the 4-factor nomogram was built based on a LASSO model.

Epidemiological statistics showed chronic illness is the main reason of illness and death of middle-aged and aged people [25, 26]. In terms of morbidity and morbidity, T2DM and cardiovascular diseases are the top five chronic diseases among people worldwide [27]. In current research, we assessed the potential relationship between clinical parameters and cardiac function. The bivariate analysis result display close connection between HDL and EAT in subjects with LVDD. Fasting insulin has consistently shown significant association with EAT in group with normal LVDF. After considering associated medical comorbidities, Cavalcante et al. discovered EAT volume as an independent predictor of impaired LVDF [4]. Eun Park et al. [5] reported that EAT volume is independent correlate of LVDF in patients with metabolic syndrome. In a longitudinal study of Olmsted County, LVDD was demonstrated to increase all-cause mortality after adjusting for clinical characteristics [28]. The article focuses on diabetic patients, which is a supplement to published research results."
Biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: contributions to risk prediction in individuals with diabetes,"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death, especially in individuals with diabetes mellitus, whose risk of morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease is markedly increased compared with the general population. There has been growing interest in the identification of biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. The present review focuses on the current and potential contributions of these biomarkers to predicting cardiovascular risk in individuals with diabetes. At present, certain biomarkers and biomarker combinations can lead to modest improvements in the prediction of cardiovascular disease in diabetes beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Emerging technologies may enable the discovery of novel biomarkers and generate new information about known biomarkers (such as new combinations of biomarkers), which could lead to significant improvements in cardiovascular disease risk prediction. A critical question, however, is whether improvements in risk prediction will affect processes of care and decision making in clinical practice, as this will be required to achieve the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in diabetes.","Treatment guidelines for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetic populations do not fully account for the heterogeneity in risk among individuals with diabetes. Certain biomarkers and combinations of biomarkers can lead to moderate improvements in cardiovascular disease risk prediction in diabetes. A critical question is whether the resultant improvement in risk stratification would lead to changes in clinical care for individuals with diabetes. The prospects for biomarker-guided management in diabetes would be further enhanced by expanding the number of biomarkers that contribute to risk stratification. Efforts to identify these biomarkers should be aided by recent advances in platforms for biomarker discovery that enable investigations involving broad panels of biomarkers not restricted to selected pathways. Ultimately, evidence from randomised trials is needed to establish whether adding biomarkers to conventional clinical assessment could lead to improved patient outcomes.

Prediction models for the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review,"Aims: To identify all cardiovascular disease risk prediction models developed in patients with type 2 diabetes or in the general population with diabetes as a covariate updating previous studies, describing model performance and analysing both their risk of bias and their applicability METHODS: A systematic search for predictive models of cardiovascular risk was performed in PubMed. The CHARMS and PROBAST guidelines for data extraction and for the assessment of risk of bias and applicability were followed. Google Scholar citations of the selected articles were reviewed to identify studies that conducted external validations.

Results: The titles of 10,556 references were extracted to ultimately identify 19 studies with models developed in a population with diabetes and 46 studies in the general population. Within models developed in a population with diabetes, only six were classified as having a low risk of bias, 17 had a favourable assessment of applicability, 11 reported complete model information, and also 11 were externally validated.","There exists an overabundance of cardiovascular risk prediction models applicable to patients with diabetes, but many have a high risk of bias due to methodological shortcomings and independent validations are scarce. We recommend following the existing guidelines to facilitate their applicability."
Prediction models for the risk of cardiovascular diseases in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review,"Objectives: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious public health issue worldwide, and DM patients have higher risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which is the leading cause of DM-related deaths. China has the largest DM population, yet a robust model to predict CVDs in Chinese DM patients is still lacking. This systematic review is carried out to summarize existing models and identify potentially important predictors for CVDs in Chinese DM patients.

Study design: Systematic review.

Methods: Medline and Embase were searched for data from April 1st, 2011 to May 31st, 2018. A study was eligible if it developed CVD (defined as total CVD or any major cardiovascular component) risk prediction models or explored potential predictors of CVD specifically for Chinese people with type 2 DM. Standardized forms were utilized to extract information, appraise applicability, risk of bias, and availabilities.

Results: Five models and 29 studies focusing on potential predictors were identified. Models for a primary care setting, or to predict total CVD, are rare. A number of common predictors (e.g. age, sex, diabetes duration, smoking status, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, lipid profile, and treatment modalities) were observed in existing models, in which urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are highly recommended for the Chinese population. Variability of blood pressure (BP) and HbA1c should be included in prediction model development as novel factors. Meanwhile, interactions between age, sex, and risk factors should also be considered.",A 10-year prediction model for CVD risk in Chinese type 2 DM patients is lacking and urgently needed. There is insufficient evidence to support the inclusion of other novel predictors in CVDs risk prediction functions for routine clinical use.
Development and validation of an equation to predict the incidence of coronary heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes in Japan,"In the diabetes treatment policy after the Kumamoto Declaration 2013, it is difficult to accurately predict the incidence of complications in patients using the JJ risk engine. This study was conducted to develop a prediction equation suitable for the current diabetes treatment policy using patient data from Kitasato University Kitasato Institute Hospital (Hospital A) and to externally validate the developed equation using patient data from Kitasato University Hospital (Hospital B). Outlier tests were performed on the patient data from Hospital A to exclude the outliers. Prediction equation was developed using the patient data excluding the outliers and was subjected to external validation.
","By excluding outlier data, we could develop a new prediction equation for the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) as a complication of type 2 diabetes, incorporating the use of antidiabetic drugs with a high risk of hypoglycemia. This is the first prediction equation in Japan that incorporates the use of antidiabetic drugs. We believe that it will be useful in preventive medicine for treatment for people at high risk of CHD as a complication of diabetes or other diseases. In the future, we would like to confirm the accuracy of this equation at other facilities."
Predicting the risk of future diabetic foot ulcer occurrence: a prospective cohort study of patients with diabetes in Tanzania,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the parameters that predict the risk of future foot ulcer occurrence in patients with diabetes.

Research design and methods: 1810 (male (M)/female (F): 1012/798) patients, with no foot ulcer at baseline, participated in this study. Data from a set of 28 parameters were collected at baseline. During follow-up, 123 (M/F: 68/55) patients ulcerated. Survival analyses together with logistic regression were used to identify the parameters that could predict the risk of future diabetic foot ulcer occurrence.

Results: A number of parameters (HR (95% CI)) including neuropathy (2.525 (1.680 to 3.795)); history of ulceration (2.796 (1.029 to 7.598)); smoking history (1.686 (1.097 to 2.592)); presence of callus (1.474 (0.999 to 2.174)); nail ingrowth (5.653 (2.078 to 15.379)); foot swelling (3.345 (1.799 to 6.218)); dry skin (1.926 (1.273 to 2.914)); limited ankle (1.662 (1.365 to 2.022)) and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (2.745 (1.853 to 4.067)) ranges of motion; and decreased (3.141 (2.102 to 4.693)), highly decreased (5.263 (1.266 to 21.878)), and absent (9.671 (5.179 to 18.059)) sensation to touch; age (1.026 (1.010 to 1.042)); vibration perception threshold (1.079 (1.060 to 1.099)); duration of diabetes (1.000 (1.000 to 1.000)); and plantar pressure at the first metatarsal head (1.003 (1.001 to 1.005)), temperature sensation (1.019 (1.004 to 1.035)) and temperature tolerance (1.523 (1.337 to 1.734)) thresholds to hot stimuli and blood sugar level (1.027 (1.006 to 1.048)) were all significantly associated with increased risk of ulceration. However, plantar pressure underneath the fifth toe (0.990 (0.983 to 0.998)) and temperature sensation (0.755 (0.688 to 0.829)) and temperature tolerance (0.668 (0.592 to 0.0754)) thresholds to cold stimuli showed to significantly decrease the risk of future ulcer occurrence. Multivariate survival model indicated that nail ingrowth (4.42 (1.38 to 14.07)); vibration perception threshold (1.07 (1.04 to 1.09)); dry skin status (4.48 (1.80 to 11.14)); and temperature tolerance threshold to warm stimuli (1.001 (1.000 to 1.002)) were significant predictors of foot ulceration risk in the final model. The mean time to ulceration was significantly (p<0.05) shorter for patients with: dry skin (χ2=11.015), nail ingrowth (χ2=14.688), neuropathy (χ2=21.284), or foot swelling (χ2=16.428).","Nail ingrowth and dry skin were found to be strong indicators of vulnerability of patients to diabetic foot ulceration. Results highlight that assessments of neuropathy in relation to both small and larger fiber impairment need to be considered for predicting the risk of diabetic foot ulceration.

Identification of Diabetes Risk Factors in Chronic Cardiovascular Patients,"Specific predictive models for diabetes polyneuropathy based on screening methods, for example Nerve conduction studies (NCS, can reach up to AUC 65.8 - 84.7 % for the conditional diagnosis of DPN in primary care. Prediction methods that utilize data from personal health records deal with large non-specific datasets with different prediction methods. Li et al. utilized 30 independent variables, which allowed to implement a model with AUC = 0.8863 for a Multilayer perceptron (MLP). Linear regression (LR) based methods produced up to AUC = 0.8 %. This way, modern data mining and computational methods can be effectively adopted in clinical medicine to derive models that use patient-specific information to predict the development of diabetic polyneuropathy, however, there still is a space to improve the efficiency of the predictive models. The goal of this study is the implementation of machine learning methods for early risk identification of diabetes polyneuropathy based on structured electronic medical records. It was demonstrated that the machine learning methods allow to achieve up to 0.7982 precision, 0.8152 recall, 0.8064 f1-score, 0.8261 accuracy, and 0.8988 AUC using the neural network classifier.",
Evaluation of cardiovascular risk in adults with type 1 diabetes: poor concordance between the 2019 ESC risk classification and 10-year cardiovascular risk prediction according to the Steno Type 1 Risk Engine,"Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have higher mortality risk compared to the general population; this is largely due to increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). As accurate CVD risk stratification is essential for an appropriate preventive strategy, we aimed to evaluate the concordance between 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) CVD risk classification and the 10-year CVD risk prediction according to the Steno Type 1 Risk Engine (ST1RE) in adults with T1D.

Methods: A cohort of 575 adults with T1D (272F/303M, mean age 36 ± 12 years) were studied. Patients were stratified in different CVD risk categories according to ESC criteria and the 10-year CVD risk prediction was estimated with ST1RE within each category.

Results: Men had higher BMI, WC, SBP than women, while no difference was found in HbA1c levels between genders. According to the ESC classification, 92.5% of patients aged < 35 years and 100% of patients ≥ 35 years were at very high/high risk. Conversely, using ST1RE to predict the 10-year CVD risk within each ESC category, among patients at very high risk according to ESC, almost all (99%) had a moderate CVD risk according to ST1RE if age < 35 years; among patients aged ≥35 years, the majority (59.1%) was at moderate risk and only 12% had a predicted very high risk by ST1RE. The presence of target organ damage or three o more CV risk factors, or early onset T1D of long duration (> 20 years) alone identified few patients (< 30%) among those aged ≥35 years, who were at very high risk according to ESC, in whom this condition was confirmed by ST1RE; conversely, the coexistence of two or more of these criteria identified about half of the patients at high/very high risk also according to this predicting algorithm. When only patients aged ≥ 50 years were considered, there was greater concordance between ESC classification and ST1RE prediction, since as many as 78% of those at high/very high risk according to ESC were confirmed as such also by ST1RE.","Using ESC criteria, a large proportion (45%) of T1D patients without CVD are classified at very high CVD risk; however, among them, none of those < 35 years and only 12% of those ≥ 35 years could be confirmed at very high CVD risk by the ST1RE predicting algorithm. More studies are needed to characterize the clinical and metabolic features of T1D patients that identify those at very high CVD risk, in whom a very aggressive cardioprotective treatment would be justified.

Developing risk prediction models for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of methodology and reporting,"The World Health Organisation estimates that by 2030 there will be approximately 350 million people with type 2 diabetes. Associated with renal complications, heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, early identification of patients with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes or those at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes is an important challenge. We sought to systematically review and critically assess the conduct and reporting of methods used to develop risk prediction models for predicting the risk of having undiagnosed (prevalent) or future risk of developing (incident) type 2 diabetes in adults.

Methods: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify studies published before May 2011 that describe the development of models combining two or more variables to predict the risk of prevalent or incident type 2 diabetes. We extracted key information that describes aspects of developing a prediction model including study design, sample size and number of events, outcome definition, risk predictor selection and coding, missing data, model-building strategies and aspects of performance.

Results: Thirty-nine studies comprising 43 risk prediction models were included. Seventeen studies (44%) reported the development of models to predict incident type 2 diabetes, whilst 15 studies (38%) described the derivation of models to predict prevalent type 2 diabetes. In nine studies (23%), the number of events per variable was less than ten, whilst in fourteen studies there was insufficient information reported for this measure to be calculated. The number of candidate risk predictors ranged from four to sixty-four, and in seven studies it was unclear how many risk predictors were considered. A method, not recommended to select risk predictors for inclusion in the multivariate model, using statistical significance from univariate screening was carried out in eight studies (21%), whilst the selection procedure was unclear in ten studies (26%). Twenty-one risk prediction models (49%) were developed by categorising all continuous risk predictors. The treatment and handling of missing data were not reported in 16 studies (41%).","We found widespread use of poor methods that could jeopardise model development, including univariate pre-screening of variables, categorisation of continuous risk predictors and poor handling of missing data. The use of poor methods affects the reliability of the prediction model and ultimately compromises the accuracy of the probability estimates of having undiagnosed type 2 diabetes or the predicted risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition, many studies were characterised by a generally poor level of reporting, with many key details to objectively judge the usefulness of the models often omitted."
Prediction of 5-year risk of diabetes mellitus in relatively low risk middle-aged and elderly adults,"To determine the potential risk factors and construct the predictive model of diabetic risk among a relatively low risk middle-aged and elderly Chinese population.

Methods: Information of participants was collected in the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study, a perspective cohort study of Chinese occupational population. The main outcome was incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Based on the conventional risk factors of diabetes, we defined low risk participants without underlying diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, dyslipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, obesity and family history of diabetes. Totally, 4833 participants from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study were enrolled, and of them, 171 had an incident diagnosis of T2DM during 4.6 years of follow-up period. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate effects of risk factors. The restricted cubic spline regression and the Youden index were used to explore the optimal cutoffs of risk factors, and the C index was used to assess the discrimination power of prediction models.

Results: There were significant linear relationships between BMI/TG level/fasting glucose level and incident diabetic risk among low risk participants. In the restricted cubic spline regression, when fasting glucose level was above 5.4 mmol/L, TG above 1.06 mmol/L and BMI above 22 kg/m2, the HRs (95% CIs) of diabetes were above 1.0. The detailed HRs (95% CI) were 1.29 (1.01, 1.64), 2.57 (1.00, 6.58), and 1.49 (1.00, 2.22), respectively. The optimal cutoff determined by the Yonden index was 1.1 mmol/L for TG, 24 kg/m2 for BMI and 5.89 mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose, respectively. The C index was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.7-0.81) when age, sex, smoke status, physical activity, BMI (< 24 kg/m2 and ≥ 24 kg/m2), TG (< 1.1 mmol/L and ≥ 1.1 mmol/L), and FPG (< 5.89 mmol/L and ≥ 5.89 mmol/L) were introduced into the diabetes predictive model.","Fasting plasma glucose level, BMI, and triglyceride level were still dominated factors to predict 5-year diabetic risk among the relatively low risk participants. The cutoff values for fasting plasma glucose, TG, and BMI set as 5.89 mmol/L, 1.1 mmol/L, and 24 kg/m2, respectively, had the best predictive discrimination of diabetes."
Comparative performance of diabetes-specific and general population-based cardiovascular risk assessment models in people with diabetes mellitus,"Multivariable models for estimating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with diabetes comprise general population-based models and those from diabetic cohorts. Whether one set of models should receive preference is unclear. We evaluated the evidence on direct comparisons of the performance of general population vs diabetes-specific CVD risk models in people with diabetes.

Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to March 2013. Two reviewers independently identified studies that compared the performance of general CVD models vs diabetes-specific ones in the same group of people with diabetes. Independent, dual data extraction on study design, risk models, outcomes; and measures of performance was conducted.

Results: Eleven articles reporting on 22 pair wise comparisons of a diabetes-specific model (UKPDS, ADVANCE and DCS risk models) to a general population model (three variants of the Framingham model, Prospective Cardiovascular Münster [PROCAM] score, CardioRisk Manager [CRM], Joint British Societies Coronary Risk Chart [JBSRC], Progetto Cuore algorithm and the CHD-Riskard algorithm) were eligible. Absolute differences in C-statistic of diabetes-specific vs general population-based models varied from -0.13 to 0.09. Comparisons for other performance measures were unusual. Outcomes definitions were congruent with those applied during model development. In 14 comparisons, the UKPDS, ADVANCE or DCS diabetes-specific models were superior to the general population CVD risk models. Authors reported better C-statistic for models they developed.",The limited existing evidence suggests a possible discriminatory advantage of diabetes-specific over general population-based models for CVD risk stratification in diabetes. More robust head-to-head comparisons are needed to confirm this trend and strengthen recommendations
DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A NOVEL TOOL TO PREDICT HOSPITAL READMISSION RISK AMONG PATIENTS WITH DIABETES,"To develop and validate a tool to predict the risk of all-cause readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) among hospitalized patients with diabetes.

Methods: A cohort of 44,203 discharges was retrospectively selected from the electronic records of adult patients with diabetes hospitalized at an urban academic medical center. Discharges of 60% of the patients (n = 26,402) were randomly selected as a training sample to develop the index. The remaining 40% (n = 17,801) were selected as a validation sample. Multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations was used to develop the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRI™).

Results: Ten statistically significant predictors were identified: employment status; living within 5 miles of the hospital; preadmission insulin use; burden of macrovascular diabetes complications; admission serum hematocrit, creatinine, and sodium; having a hospital discharge within 90 days before admission; most recent discharge status up to 1 year before admission; and a diagnosis of anemia. Discrimination of the model was acceptable (C statistic 0.70), and calibration was good. Characteristics of the validation and training samples were similar. Performance of the DERRI™ in the validation sample was essentially unchanged (C statistic 0.69). Mean predicted 30-d readmission risks were also similar between the training and validation samples (39.3% and 38.7% in the highest quintiles).","The DERRI™ was found to be a valid tool to predict all-cause 30-d readmission risk of individual patients with diabetes. The identification of high-risk patients may encourage the use of interventions targeting those at greatest risk, potentially leading to better outcomes and lower healthcare costs."
A risk prediction model of gestational diabetes mellitus before 16 gestational weeks in Chinese pregnant women,"To develop a GDM risk stratification model in Chinese pregnant women using machine learning algorithm, for judgment of the risk of GDM before 16 gestation weeks.

Methods: A retrospective study of 17005 pregnant women with 1965 women developed GDM. Maternal clinical routine examination indicators, disease history and other clinical characteristics of pregnant women were obtained before 16 gestation weeks. Maternal clinical parameters were analyzed, selected and divided into 6 groups. The prediction models were constructed using LR (logistic regression) and RF (random forest), and were evaluated using areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). The cut-off value of the predicted probability of GDM was calculated by interquartile range. The performance of models was internal validated.

Results: We developed a GDM risk stratification prediction model in Chinese pregnant women before 16 gestation weeks, with the AUC 0.746 and 15 parameters included. The model presented reliable ability to predictively stratify GDM risk of population. And the ≥ 7.77% predicted risk cut-off showed a strong ability to rule out GDM in women who predicted negative before 16 gestational weeks.",Our study provide a simple and effective screening method for clinical GDM risk stratification in Chinese pregnant women before 16 gestation weeks.
Predicting risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Korean adults aged 40-69 by integrating clinical and genetic factors,"The purpose of our investigation was to identify the genetic and clinical risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to predict the incidence of T2DM in Korean adults aged 40-69 at follow-up intervals of 5, 7, and 10years.

Methods: Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) cohort data (n=10,030) were used to develop T2DM prediction models. Both clinical-only and integrated (clinical factors+genetic factors) models were derived using the Cox proportional hazards model. Internal validation was performed to evaluate the prediction capabilities of the clinical and integrated models.

Results: The clinical model included 10 selected clinical risk factors. The selected SNPs for the integrated model were rs9311835 in PTPRG, rs10975266 in RIC1, rs11057302 in TMED2, rs17154562 in ADAM12, and rs8038172 in CGNL1. For the clinical model, validated c-indices with time points of 5, 7, and 10 years were 0.744, 0.732, and 0.732, respectively. Slightly higher validated c-indices were observed for the integrated model at 0.747, 0.736, and 0.738, respectively. The p-values of the survival net reclassification improvement (NRI) for the SNP point-based score were statistically significant.",Clinical and integrated models can be effectively used to predict the incidence of T2DM in Koreans.
Performance of Stepwise Screening Methods in Identifying Individuals at High Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in an Iranian Population,"Recent evidence recommended stepwise screening methods for identifying individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes to be recruited in the lifestyle intervention programs for the prevention of the disease. This study aims to assess the performance of different stepwise screening methods that combine non-invasive measurements with lab-based measurements for identifying those with 5-years incident type 2 diabetes.

Methods: 3037 participants aged ≥30 years without diabetes at baseline in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) were followed. Thirty-two stepwise screening methods were developed by combining a non-invasive measurement (an anthropometric measurement (waist-to-height ratio, WtHR) or a score based on a non-invasive risk score [Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool, AUSDRISK]) with a lab-based measurement (different cut-offs of fasting plasma glucose [FPG] or predicted risk based on three lab-based prediction models [Saint Antonio, SA; Framingham Offspring Study, FOS; and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, ARIC]). The validation, calibration, and usefulness of lab-based prediction models were assessed before developing the stepwise screening methods. Cut-offs were derived either based on previous studies or decision-curve analyses.

Results: 203 participants developed diabetes in 5 years. Lab-based risk prediction models had good discrimination power (area under the curves [AUCs]: 0.80-0.83), achieved acceptable calibration and net benefits after recalibration for population's characteristics and were useful in a wide range of risk thresholds (5%-21%). Different stepwise methods had sensitivity ranged 20%-68%, specificity 70%-98%, and positive predictive value (PPV) 14%-46%; they identified 3%-33% of the screened population eligible for preventive interventions.","Summary of Findings
This is the first study that developed several stepwise methods for identifying those at high risk of type 2 diabetes and assessed their performance in Iranian population. This study also validated three well-known lab-based risk prediction models. We showed that, after calibration, lab-based prediction models are valid tools for the prediction of the risk of type 2 diabetes and using them in combination with non-invasive measurements can form effective stepwise screening methods with acceptable sensitivity (identifying up to 68% of individuals with 5-year incident type 2 diabetes) and specificity (excluding 70% of individuals without 5-year incident type 2 diabetes). Using stepwise methods can also eliminate the need for lab measurements in about half of the screened population and limit the proportion of the population who need preventive interventions to less than 35%.

Validation of Lab-Based Prediction Models
In the current study, the discrimination power of the lab-based risk prediction models were good with AUCs >0.80; these findings are in line with previous studies that showed high discrimination power of these models (AUC >0.80) in different populations.21,22,33-36 High discrimination power of these models in the Iranian population indicates that lab measurements used in these models have high predictive power in this population.28,36 In regards with calibration, however, the original models overestimated the risk of 5-year incident type 2 diabetes in our study that was rectified after calibration of the intercept of the ARIC and SA models and calibration of intercept and slope of the FOS model.28,36 The lack of calibration in the original models might be rooted in differences in the follow-up period or ethnicity.28,36 All three models in these study were developed to predict the risk of the type 2 diabetes in studies with follow-up longer than 5 years (ranged 7-9 years)19,20,23 and using these models for predicting the risk of 5-year incident type 2 diabetes led to an overestimation of the risk.28,36 Moreover, previous studies showed the important role of ethnicity in the development of type 2 diabetes even accounting for other type 2 diabetes risk factors.37 Our findings also showed that by simple calibration of models, these prediction models can predict the risk of 5-year incident type 2 diabetes in the Iranian population with high validity. These findings were further supported by our net benefit assessment of the models that showed calibrated models are useful in a wide range of risk thresholds ranged from 4% to 21%.

Performance of Stepwise Screening Methods
The stepwise methods developed in this study had acceptable performance in identifying those at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 68% and specificities ranging from 70% to 98%; these findings are comparable with those of previous studies.9,12,38 In a study conducted by Lee et al,9 six different stepwise methods were developed by combining AUSDRISK prediction model and a blood test (FPG, hemoglobin A1c [HBA1c], or oral glucose tolerance test) with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 47% and specificities ranging from 81% to 98%.

Given the fact that these screening strategies fail to identify between one-third to half of the participants with 5-year incident type 2 diabetes, one might suggest reducing the cut-offs for non-invasive or lab-based measurements to increase stepwise screening methods sensitivity. We, however, discourage reducing the cut-offs due to some problems involved in it. First, lower cut-offs increase the sensitivity of a test with the price of a reduction in its specificity and PPV, so it means that the population who screened positive based on the tests would have a lower risk of developing 5-year incident type 2 diabetes. There is strong evidence showing that the lifestyle intervention programs have limited effectiveness in individuals at low risk of developing type 2 diabetes and previous studies recommended to deliver these interventions to those with at least 20% risk of developing type 2 diabetes in short time.1-5 Therefore, we here recommend those stepwise screening methods with PPVs higher than 20%. Another problem with lowering cut-offs for stepwise screening methods is exposing further pressure on laboratory resources and the healthcare system as it requires further laboratory tests in the population and leads to a higher number of eligible participants, most of whom will be false positives. A practical and feasible solution to improve recruitment of individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes is to use readily-available information collected during different medical procedures in addition to stepwise screening methods. For example, in the National Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Program in Finland,7 in addition to those who had a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes based on a stepwise screening method, people with a history of elevated blood glucose in their medical records or a history of gestational diabetes were recruited in the lifestyle interventions.

We avoid recommending a particular stepwise screening method in our study. We instead recommend healthcare providers to select the best option based on the acceptability of screening methods, available intervention programs, and resources in their settings. For example, in case that the available preventive interventions are costly and resource-intensive, a screening method that selected lower proportion of the screened population with higher risk would be preferable, while in case of inexpensive interventions or settings with ample resources, screening methods with higher sensitivities would be preferable. One should also consider the potential impacts of the screening methods on the outcome of lifestyle interventions. Assuming that lifestyle intervention programs reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 30% in Iranian population - which is consistence with previous meta-analyses1–5-, using a stepwise screening method with a sensitivity of about 50% (such as WtHR ≥0.55-FPG ≥5.5 mmol/L) potentially can lead to a reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the whole population by 15%; while the corresponding impact would be 18% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the whole population if a stepwise method with a sensitivity of about 60% (such as WtHR ≥0.55-SA ≥7.5%) will be used.39

We here also highlight the fact that these screening methods for identifying those at high risk of type 2 diabetes do not eliminate the need for screening for other cardiometabolic risk factors or routine check-ups in the community. Undoubtedly, we need valid and reliable screening methods as well as effective interventions for other cardiometabolic risk factors to achieve ideal cardio-metabolic health.

Strengths and Limitations
This study has some strengths and limitations. For strengths, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first study that developed stepwise screening methods for identifying those at high risk of type 2 diabetes in the LMIC and it is the first comparative validation study in Iran for these three well-known risk prediction models. The large sample size is one of the main strengths of this study, leading to high precision in our estimates. As for limitations, we had a drop-out rate of 27%. To address this limitation, we imputed the missing information in our sensitivity analyses; the findings of which were generally similar to those of original analyses. We used Hosmer–Lemeshow Chi-square to assess the calibration of the models, while some evidence showed that this test has a high rejection rate of acceptable models when large samples are used40; to address this limitation, we plotted predicted outcome probabilities (x-axis) against observed outcomes (y-axis) using a LOWESS line as recommended in guidelines by Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis Initiative.30 Moreover, we did not use HbA1c cut points to define type 2 diabetes in this study. HbA1c did not measure in the different waves of TLGS because HbA1c was not introduced as a component for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at the time of designing TLGS (year: 1999); it was costly measurement, and there was not a standardized method for measurement of HbA1c in Iranian population. This limitation might lead to missing a subgroup of people with type 2 diabetes with high HbA1C but normal FPG and 2hPG; however, this limitation hardly can affect the findings of this study since the previous studies showed that very small proportion of undiagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes have high HbA1c but normal FPG and 2hPG (~0.3%).41"
Role of molecular genetics in transforming diagnosis of diabetes mellitus,"Most common diseases also run in families as rare, monogenic forms. Diabetes is no exception. Mutations in approximately 20 different genes are now known to cause monogenic diabetes, a disease group that can be subclassified into maturity-onset diabetes of the young, neonatal diabetes and mitochondrial diabetes. In some families, additional features, such as urogenital malformations, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and neurological abnormalities, are present and may aid the diagnostic classification. The finding of a mutation in monogenic diabetes may have implications for the prediction of prognosis and choice of treatment. Mutations in the GCK gene cause a mild form of diabetes, which seldom needs insulin and has a low risk for complications. By contrast, HNF1A mutations lead to a diabetes form that in severity, treatment and complication risk resembles Type 1 diabetes, although these patients may experience a good effect of sulfonylurea treatment. The majority of neonatal diabetes cases are caused by mutations in the K(ATP) channel genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11, and sulfonylurea therapy is then usually superior to insulin. Diseases with a considerable genetic component may now be explored by genome-wide approaches using next-generation DNA sequencing technology. We expect that within a few years important breakthroughs will be made in mapping cases of diabetes with a suspected, but still unsolved monogenic basis.

Validation of prediction of diabetes by the Archimedes model and comparison with other predicting models,"To validate the ability of the Archimedes model to accurately predict the risk of developing diabetes in individuals.

Research design and methods: Subjects were randomly selected from the San Antonio Heart Study population. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (aROC) curve derived from the Archimedes model was calculated and also compared with the aROCs from two published multiple logistic regression models designed to estimate diabetes risk.

Results: The aROC for the Archimedes model was 0.818 (95% CI 0.739-0.899) compared with aROCs of 0.869 (0.801-0.936) and 0.870 (0.802-0.937) for the two logistic regression models, respectively. Risk estimates from the logistic models were highly correlated with the estimates derived from the Archimedes model.
","With an aROC of 0.818, it is evident that the accuracy of Diabetes PHD (i.e., Archimedes) to predict an individual's risk of diabetes is excellent—almost as high as models specifically designed and used only for that purpose. The SAHS model may have had an unfair advantage over Archimedes because it was designed and optimized using the SAHS database and could be overfitted to the subset of SAHS cases selected for this analysis. It was for that reason that we used the ARIC predicting model: the latter was developed in an entirely independent dataset and performed as well as the SAHS model.

Both the SAHS and ARIC models were built from person-specific data and optimized specifically for predicting incident diabetes. In contrast, Archimedes was designed to be used for a very wide range of purposes, calculates many different outcomes, was not built from person-specific data, and was not calibrated to determine the incidence of diabetes. Also, several of the variables Archimedes uses that may have enhanced its predictive capability were not included in this analysis.

This report extends the validation of Archimedes and demonstrates its excellent ability to discriminate between individuals who will or will not develop diabetes. Its utility is comparable with models developed solely for that purpose. Because Diabetes PHD, derived from Archimedes, is freely available on the internet and calculates many additional outcomes, it is a powerful tool that can be reliably used for comprehensive risk assessment and decision making. Diabetes PHD is now widely accessed (∼80,000 users per year) for use in comprehensive risk assessment of cardiometabolic disease over a 30-year period and that helps diabetic patients better appreciate the likely benefits of risk factor reduction. Although the tool currently uses complex distributive computing, which limits its speed and capacity, a much more rapid version will soon become available with unlimited capacity. This will allow for widespread promotion."
Cardiovascular risk and diabetes. Are the methods of risk prediction satisfactory?,"Methods available to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk include the Joint British Societies Risk Chart (JBSRC), the CardioRisk Manager (CRM) calculator, the PROCAM calculation and specific to diabetes, the UKPDS risk engine. Our aim was to examine their efficacy in a clinic-based population of diabetic patients.

Design: Patients were identified who attended clinic at baseline (1990-1991) and categorised by the presence/absence of CHD/CVD at follow-up (2000-2001). Ten-year risk was calculated using JBSRC, CRM, PROCAM and the UKPDS risk engine.

Methods: A total of 798 patients were identified under follow-up (2000-2001), with sufficient data for risk prediction. Risk prediction methods were assessed by: (1) the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (calibration test); (2) the C-index, derived from the ROC curve [a discriminatory measure ranging from 0.5 (no discrimination) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination)]; and (3) Spearman correlation of the observed and predicted risk.

Results: All tests (except PROCAM) demonstrated acceptable discrimination with respect to CHD/CVD, however, all underestimated the risk of future events. With respect to CVD, the JBSRC had a C-index of 0.80, CRM: 0.76, UKPDS: 0.74 and PROCAM: 0.67. With respect to CHD the C-indexes were 0.77, 0.73, 0.65 and 0.76 respectively. Risk prediction by CRM had a stronger relationship with observed events than UKPDS and PROCAM (r=0.97, 0.86, 0.81 respectively).","All scores have reasonable discrimination, but underestimate future events. The CRM showed the strongest correlation between observed and predicted risk with the least amount of scatter from the line of best fit. The CRM, when adjusted by the calibration factor, provides the most accurate method of risk prediction."
Prediction of 3-year risk of diabetic kidney disease using machine learning based on electronic medical records,"Established prediction models of Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) are limited to the analysis of clinical research data or general population data and do not consider hospital visits. Construct a 3-year diabetic kidney disease risk prediction model in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using machine learning, based on electronic medical records (EMR).

Methods: Data from 816 patients (585 males) with T2DM and 3 years of follow-up at the PLA General Hospital. 46 medical characteristics that are readily available from EMR were used to develop prediction models based on seven machine learning algorithms (light gradient boosting machine [LightGBM], eXtreme gradient boosting, adaptive boosting, artificial neural network, decision tree, support vector machine, logistic regression). Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was used to interpret the results of the best performing model.

Results: The LightGBM model had the highest AUC (0.815, 95% CI 0.747-0.882). Recursive feature elimination with random forest and SHAP plot based on LightGBM showed that older patients with T2DM with high homocysteine (Hcy), poor glycemic control, low serum albumin (ALB), low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and high bicarbonate had an increased risk of developing DKD over the next 3 years.","This study identified predictive risk factors for DKD and constructed a 3-year DKD risk prediction model in patients with T2DM and normo-albuminuria using machine learning and clinical variables easily extracted from EMR. The performance of predictive models generated by seven machine learning algorithms were compared. Findings showed the LightGBM model had the highest AUC, sensitivity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values. LightGBM is a high-performance gradient boosting framework [28, 29] that has been used for the prediction of undiagnosed T2DM, based on EMR [30]. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first published study to apply the LightGBM algorithm to predict the 3-year risk of DKD in patients with T2DM and normo-albuminuria who attended a hospital.

EMR has increased access to large amounts of patient data. This, combined with machine learning, is facilitating the development of sophisticated prediction models [31, 32]. Previous reports have presented machine learning techniques as black boxes, providing little information on how predictions have been made. This has hampered uptake by clinicians, who are reluctant to make medical diagnoses based on non-transparent decision-making. In this study, to facilitate interpretation of the decision process of the LightGBM algorithm, we used SHAP methodology to explain our predictions [33]. Baseline age, Hcy, HbA1c, BMI, Alb, eGFR, bicarbonate and LDL were selected as variables relevant for predicting 3-year DKD risk in patients with T2DM and normo-albuminuria. Previous studies have identified these as medically, socially, and economically important variables for quantifying the risk of CKD as a microvascular long-term complication of diabetes [34–36]. Consistent with this, our SHAP summary and dependence plots showed that baseline age, Hcy, HbA1c, Alb, eGFR and bicarbonate could distinguish patients at high or low 3-year risk of developing DKD. Specifically, older patients with high Hcy, poor glycemic control, low Alb, low eGFR, and high bicarbonate had a high 3-year risk of developing DKD. SHAP visualizations provide clinical insight and inform clinical decision-making, but highlight the complexity of predictive models. In this case, SHAP dependence plots revealed an increased 3-year risk of DKD in patients with T2DM and normo-albuminuria who had high or low eGFR, BMI or LDL.

Machine learning has confirmed that several biomarkers have prognostic use and may help investigators identify novel risk factors and provide insight into disease pathogenesis [37]. Ongoing research has identified multiple risk factors for DKD. In the present study, patients with T2DM aged > 60 years, eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73m2, poor glycemic control, and high or low BMI had a high 3-year risk of developing DKD. Accordingly, older age was identified as a risk factor for DKD progression, independent of diabetes duration, in patients with T2DM [38]; a prospective observational cohort study of patients with T2DM followed for 10-years reported that albuminuria, older age, hypertension, insulin therapy, and lower baseline eGFR were independent predictors of annual eGFR decline [39]; and poor glycemic control and elevated BMI have been associated with the development and progression of DKD [40]. eGFR, glycemic control, and BMI are modifiable risk factors for DKD, such that the rational use of sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and other drugs in patients with T2DM may be beneficial. Interestingly, the present study also showed patients with T2DM, normo-albuminuria and an eGFR120-130 ml/min/1.73m2 (hyperfiltration) had a high 3-year risk of developing DKD. While more research is required, evidence suggests that glomerular or whole kidney hyperfiltration is a major contributing factor to the development of DKD in patients with type 1 or T2DM [41, 42]. Specifically, cohort studies with 3–18 years of follow-up showed that GFR declines more rapidly in patients with hyperfiltration at baseline compared to those with normal GFR [43].

The relationship between lipid profile and DKD is complex. Previous reports suggest dyslipidemia as a potential risk marker for DKD, but it is unclear which lipids or lipoproteins should be targeted for intervention [44]. In this study, LDL was included as a potential predictor of 3-year DKD risk, and it had a small impact on the output of the prediction model. Consistent with this, renal progression was significantly associated with LDL-cholesterol in patients with T1DM and normoalbuminuria followed for 8–9 years [44], substantiating experimental data and clinical studies that show targeted use of statins may represent a successful renoprotective strategy in diabetes [45, 46]. Irrespective of the association with DKD, dyslipidemia has a strong association with overall cardiovascular risk, making the control of dyslipidemia, especially LDL, essential for patients with diabetes. The benefits of pursuing lipid targets in patients without known cardiovascular disease are controversial [47]. In the present study, 23.8% of patients had cardiovascular disease at baseline, and SHAP dependence plots revealed patients with T2DM and high or low or LDL had an increased 3-year risk of DKD.

Homocysteine, Alb, and bicarbonate are not traditionally associated with increased risk for DKD. However, one study in Chinese patients with diabetes indicated a causal relationship between elevated circulating homocysteine levels and risk of DKD [48]; in hospitalized Han patients with T2DM, low serum Alb concentration was independently associated with diabetic retinopathy and DKD [30]; and serum albumin was identified as an important predictor of ESRD in patients with T2DM and DKD from three clinical trials (RENAAL [n = 1513], IDNT [n = 1715]and ALTITUDE [n = 8561]) using a feedforward neural network [40]. Bicarbonate may represent a novel risk factor for DKD [49]. Patients with diabetes with advanced renal failure show a lower prevalence or a less severe degree of metabolic acidosis [50], potentially through feedback control involving systemic acid–base status and hydrogen ion production that inhibits ketoacid anion production [51].

This study has several strengths. First, we used RWD derived from EMR, which is likely more representative of the diverse T2DM patient population than data derived from clinical trials. Second, among the other algorithms, the LightGBM model performed the best. LightGBM is a highly optimized gradient boosting decision tree algorithm that can incorporate multiple clinical variables Third, we identified risk factors that have not been traditionally associated with increased risk for DKD. Fourth, most studies have targeted patients with CKD and an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 or ESRD [52]. We included patients with DKD presenting with new-onset micro- and macro- albuminuria. Fifth, our model can be used by clinicians and nurses as a visual approach to predict 3-year risk of DKD in patients with T2DM and normo-albuminuria, appropriately manage patients with T2DM and normo-albuminuria at high-risk for DKD and to target risk factors for DKD, thus informing the allocation of healthcare resources. Last, the model can be used as a screening tool for clinical trials. Enriching trials with patients at high 3-year risk of developing DKD may reduce sample sizes and lead to more efficient drug development programs.

This study was associated with some limitations. It was conducted at a single institution, included a small sample size, and the missing information (e.g., use of hypoglycemic drugs, history of diabetes, blood pressure) in our EMR-derived data represented a potential bias. However, we believe our rigorous methodology generated a robust predictive model of 3-year DKD risk in patients with T2DM and normo-albuminuria. External validation using another data set is required to establish stability in the performance of our prediction model."
Waist-to-hip ratio is a better anthropometric index than body mass index for predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes in Taiwanese population,"Body mass index (BMI) has been reported to be related to the risk of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) can better reflect the accumulation of intra-abdominal fat and might be a better predictor than BMI of the risk of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We hypothesized that other anthropometric indices rather than BMI could more accurately predict the risk of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine which anthropometric index can be a better predictor for forecasting the risk of type 2 diabetes and hypertension in the Taiwanese population. We conducted a cross-sectional study and reviewed data derived from the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan, 1993-1996. The subjects were 2545 men and 2562 women, aged 18 to 96 years. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to measure the predictive diabetic and hypertensive performance of each anthropometric measurement based on the area under the curve (AUC). Among 5 anthropometric indices, WHR had a significantly adjusted odds ratio (OR) and the highest AUC (0.72 for men and 0.80 for women) to predict the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although BMI had a significantly adjusted OR, the AUC was not the highest among the 5 anthropometric indices used to predict the risk of hypertension. Our findings suggested that WHR is a better anthropometric index for predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes, and the optimal cutoff values of WHR are considered as 0.89 for men and 0.82 for women in the Taiwanese population.","Several studies have indicated that age is a confounder when using anthropometric indices to predict the risk of type 2 diabetes or hypertension [10], [12], [19]. Daniel et al [10] stratified subjects into 3 age categories: 18-34 (n = 53), 35-49 (n = 62), and at least 50 years (n = 36), showing that age confounded the association between WHR and glycemic status. We also stratified our subjects according to age but used different categories than the one used by Daniel et al: 18-44 (n = 2266),"
Development and validation of a nomogram model for individualized prediction of hypertension risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with hypertension (DH) is the most common diabetic comorbidity. Patients with DH have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram model for the prediction of an individual's risk of developing DH. A total of 706 T2DM patients who met the criteria were selected and divided into a training set (n = 521) and a validation set (n = 185) according to the discharge time of patients. By using multivariate logistic regression analysis and stepwise regression, the DH nomogram prediction model was created. Calibration curves were used to evaluate the model's accuracy, while decision curve analysis (DCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the model's clinical applicability and discriminatory power. Age, body mass index (BMI), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic retinopathy (DR) were all independent risk factors for DH (P < 0.05). Based on independent risk factors identified by multivariate logistic regression, the nomogram model was created. The model produces accurate predictions. If the total nomogram score is greater than 120, there is a 90% or higher chance of developing DH. In the training and validation sets, the model's ROC curves are 0.762 (95% CI 0.720-0.803) and 0.700 (95% CI 0.623-0.777), respectively. The calibration curve demonstrates that there is good agreement between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes. The decision curve analysis findings demonstrated that the nomogram model was clinically helpful throughout a broad threshold probability range. The DH risk prediction nomogram model constructed in this study can help clinicians identify individuals at high risk for DH at an early stage, which is a guideline for personalized prevention and treatments.","The prevalence of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes was 56.9% which was 1.32 times higher than that in patients without hypertension in this study. This finding is similar to the findings of hypertension prevalence in type 2 diabetic patients from a universal health checkup conducted in Urumqi, Xinjiang, China in 201812. Therefore, to better predict the risk of combined hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes, we constructed a hypertension risk nomogram prediction modeAThe nomogram is a visual tool for predicting the probability of occurrence of events based on statistical models with multiple factors28. Over the past few years, the use of nomograms to construct predictive models has become widely adopted29. The ability of clinical nomogram prediction models to more accurately predict individual disease risk based on different patient conditions may aid clinical decision-making. Stepwise regression results combined with multifactorial logistic regression model analysis in this study showed that age, BMI, DN, and RD were independent risk factors for DH.

The results of this study showed that age was a risk factor for hypertension. Hypertension prevalence increased with age30,31. This can be mainly due to the gradual hardening of the large arteries as we age and the gradual loss of vascular elasticity, leading to increased blood pressure32. Variability in blood pressure also increases with age, and in addition to these age-related factors, comorbidities such as dyslipidemia and elevated blood glucose increase with aging. Over time, vascular endothelial cell dysfunction occurs, with a decline in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and aging of the kidney, which leads to restricted arterial dilation33. Therefore, patients with type 2 diabetes need to have their blood pressure monitored more closely as they age, and if hypertension is detected, it needs to be controlled with appropriate medications based on lifestyle interventions to reduce the risk of heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.

In the prediction model, BMI was an influential factor in the development of hypertension, which is consistent with previous studies34. In addition, Huang et al. also found that BMI was an independent risk factor for hypertension risk35. Similarly, a study conducted in Taiwan found that BMI is the main and independent determinant of blood pressure and hypertension in adult type 2 diabetes patients in Taiwan36. BMI is currently used clinically as an indicator of overweight or obesity. Compared to other commonly used measures of obesity, BMI is the most sensitive body indicator to predict high blood pressure in adults37. At the pathophysiological level, the core mechanism of obesity associated with T2DM is insulin resistance. Similarly, the mechanisms associated with the development of obesity and hypertension include insulin resistance, and the remaining mechanisms include inflammation, oxidation, active stress, and excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system38–40. These factors interact to cause systemic hemodynamic alterations. The obese population is at high risk for hypertension and obesity promotes atherosclerosis41. Pathophysiological changes associated with obesity include increased arterial stiffness42, as well as altered reflex sensitivity to pressure receptors, which is also responsible for increased variability in blood pressure. Therefore, patients with type 2 diabetes need good lifestyle interventions43, such as smoking cessation and alcohol restriction, moderate exercise, low-salt and low-fat and multi-vitamin diets, which can effectively maintain a healthy body state and reduce weight. These measures can effectively improve insulin resistance, which not only facilitates blood glucose control but also has beneficial effects on blood pressure and blood lipids44.

Microvascular complications are the leading cause of mortality in diabetic patients, and DN and DR are the most severe microvascular complications. Common pathogenesis shared by DR and isare high glucose toxicity, free radicals, oxidative stress of inflammatory mediators, and abnormal polyols metabolism, all of which play very important roles45. Most people with type 2 diabetes will develop DN and DR if they have had diabetes for more than 20 years. As chronic hyperglycemia impairs vascular endothelial cell function, vascular inflammation occurs, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular elasticity46 and increased peripheral resistance. The kidney is both an important organ for blood pressure regulation and a major target organ for hypertension damage. DN causes disorders in salt and water regulation in the kidney, especially abnormalities in the renin-angiotensin system47 and abnormalities in the sympathetic nervous system48. All of the above factors interact with each other, resulting in the development and progression of hypertension49, whereas the presence of hypertension may further worsen DR and DN50.

There are some limitations in this study: firstly, the data in this study were obtained from a single center and were retrospective, which may have some information bias and patient selection bias; a prospective study design is necessary for the future. Secondly, in terms of model validation, only internal validation was performed, and further validation of the model with a large multicenter sample is needed to assess the applicability of the model in the future. Finally, we did not collect information about coronary heart disease, stroke, lower limb amputation, heart failure, and other diseases highly related to hypertension, which may affect the prediction ability of our model."
Prognostic value of exercise capacity in incident diabetes: a country with high prevalence of diabetes,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a fast-growing health problem that imposes an enormous economic burden. Several studies demonstrated the association between physical inactivity and predicting the incidence of diabetes. However, these prediction models have limited validation locally. Therefore, we aim to explore the predictive value of exercise capacity in the incidence of diabetes within a high diabetes prevalence population.

Methodology: A retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients free of diabetes who underwent clinically indicated treadmill stress testing. Diabetic patients at baseline or patients younger than 18 years of age were excluded. Incident diabetes was defined as an established clinical diagnosis post-exercise testing date. The predictive value of exercise capacity was examined using Harrell's c-index, net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI).

Results: A total of 8,722 participants (mean age 46 ± 12 years, 66.3% were men) were free of diabetes at baseline. Over a median follow-up period of 5.24 (2.17-8.78) years, there were 2,280 (≈ 26%) new cases of diabetes. In a multivariate model adjusted for conventional risk factors, we found a 12% reduction in the risk of incident diabetes for each METs achieved (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.88-0.92; P < 0.001). Using Cox regression, exercise capacity improved the prediction ability beyond the conventional risk factors (AUC = 0.62 to 0.66 and c-index = 0.62 to 0.68).","This study investigated the relationship between exercise capacity and incident diabetes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first large and demographically diverse cohort to examine the association between CRF estimated by METs using a standard test (Bruce protocol) by exercise treadmill testing and the risk of incident diabetes in the MENA region. It has shown that higher fitness was inversely associated with incident diabetes, such that every increment of fitness by 1 METs was associated with a 12% lower risk of incident diabetes. Another important finding in our study was the inverse linear relationship between CRF and diabetes, which notably did not show evidence of plateauing or reversal at higher levels of CRF regardless of age, sex, or other diabetes risk factors.

The mechanism that links the relationship between fitness and incident diabetes is a subject of much discussion. Individuals with low cardiorespiratory fitness have high insulin resistance[11], and low levels of CRF have fewer glucose transporters[12] compared with those more fit. It is thought to be mediated by positive changes in the human body tissue profile, reduced adiposity[13], and an immediate increase in insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal[14]. However, several studies have shown that impaired oxidative respiration due to mitochondrial dysfunction[15] underlies the pathogenesis of diabetes reflecting a native genetic state independent of physical activity[16].

Scattered small cross-sectional studies have shown that exercise capacity is inversely associated with impaired glycemic control[17], the metabolic syndrome[18], diabetes[19] and positively associated with glucose disposal rate and insulin sensitivity[20]. Unfortunately, these studies have been small and confined to limited demographic settings (single-sex, racial group, or age-group). Others had reported the relationship between CRF level and the incident diabetes in prospective[21–23] or measuring CFR differently[24].

Low CFR in diabetic patients is an independent risk factor for mortality, and it was associated with 2.1 odds of mortality compared with high CFR diabetic patients[25]. Long-standing diabetes leads to consequences of peripheral neuropathy and vasculopathy with the reduction in the activity of daily living, poor physical function, and disability[26–28]. Additionally, concomitant diabetes risk factors expedite the complications’ progression and highlight the need for urgent intervention on several prevention levels[29]. Implementing the WHO recommendations for reducing physical inactivity by 10–15% will gradually reduce T2DM in adults[30]. A 150-min of moderate-intensity exercise weekly was associated with a reduction of T2DM by 26%[31].

Study limitations and strengths
Our study is not without limitations. First, cardiovascular health is independently associated with behaviors that may represent the causal contributing to fitness. Unfortunately, we are unable to assess these behaviors in our study formally. Second, incident diabetes was based on medical records and administrative claims files, which were not collected initially to examine diabetes. As a result, our study did not include study protocol–based direct measurements of hemoglobin A1c, blood glucose, or oral glucose tolerance testing. Because of this, several people with undiagnosed diabetes may have been included in our study population or missed as incident cases, attenuating our results. Third, our study population comprised persons referred for stress testing, which undoubtedly carries a higher burden of cardiovascular disease at baseline than the general population and may have led to referral bias. That limits our study’s generalizability. Fourth, residual confounding is always a concern with observational studies, especially with covariates assessed via the medical record rather than a direct measurement. Finally, our study reports a single center’s experience with its unique practice patterns and mode of operation. Thus, although the cohort studied was diverse, it may not represent the entire adult population of Saudi Arabia.

On the other hand, our study has some strengths. The standard stress testing, the Bruce protocol treadmill test, characterized fitness rather than self-reporting physical activity. This way is readily interpreted in clinical settings. Furthermore, our study sample was a large and diverse sample, which adequately powered our study."
Predicting absolute risk of type 2 diabetes using age and waist circumference values in an aboriginal Australian community,"To predict in an Australian Aboriginal community, the 10-year absolute risk of type 2 diabetes associated with waist circumference and age on baseline examination.

Method: A sample of 803 diabetes-free adults (82.3% of the age-eligible population) from baseline data of participants collected from 1992 to 1998 were followed-up for up to 20 years till 2012. The Cox-proportional hazard model was used to estimate the effects of waist circumference and other risk factors, including age, smoking and alcohol consumption status, of males and females on prediction of type 2 diabetes, identified through subsequent hospitalisation data during the follow-up period. The Weibull regression model was used to calculate the absolute risk estimates of type 2 diabetes with waist circumference and age as predictors.

Results: Of 803 participants, 110 were recorded as having developed type 2 diabetes, in subsequent hospitalizations over a follow-up of 12633.4 person-years. Waist circumference was strongly associated with subsequent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with P<0.0001 for both genders and remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounding factors. Hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes associated with 1 standard deviation increase in waist circumference were 1.7 (95%CI 1.3 to 2.2) for males and 2.1 (95%CI 1.7 to 2.6) for females. At 45 years of age with baseline waist circumference of 100 cm, a male had an absolute diabetic risk of 10.9%, while a female had a 14.3% risk of the disease.","Using long-term cohort data from a remote community, we have developed a simple model to estimate 10-year risk of T2D in an Aboriginal Australian community based on two variables: WC and age. The results are based on a maximum of 20 years follow-up (median, 18 years) and ascertainment of T2D incidence cases. The values for the two predictors used can easily be obtained by individuals and in clinical practice. The absolute risk chart we developed is simple to use and understand. The availability of the simple tool to predict future risk of T2D should improve the understanding of WC on T2D risk and identify high-risk individuals based on WC and age. It can also serve as an adjunct for planning and conducting public health education programs for T2D and augment preventive strategies for Aboriginal communities.

Our approach based on the absolute risk method calculated from Weibull regression takes into account the synergetic effects of risk factors of disease of interest [25]. This approach took into account the different follow-up time of all participants in the study to predict the risk of the disease. We have presented the prediction to a 10 year period as the goal of this study is to assess how risk of T2D change with WC values with a given age to assist in alerting individuals of the risk of T2D with increasing WC. While T2D is a complex multifactorial disease, and the cause originates from interactions among a number of risk genetic and environmental predictors, increased risk in Australia has been associated with increasing age, family history of diabetes, overweight (particularly with extra weight around the waist region), of indigenous Australian descent, lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet and high blood pressure [26]. Unfortunately, we have no available data for family history of diabetes, physical activity and diet. The focus of this study was to calculate gender-specific absolute risk estimates for a community of Aboriginal Australians according to WC and age while adjusting for age, smoking and drinking in the multivariate analysis. Central obesity measured by WC has been known to increase the risk of T2D in the Australian Aboriginal population [6, 13]. In the present study, we showed WC was a slightly better predictor of T2D than BMI and was much better at predicting T2D than WHR. This is consistent with the study conducted by Wang and Hoy (2004) in the same community presenting the odds ratio for diabetes after adjusting for age and sex to be 2.16, 1.80, 1.41, 1.81 and 1.84 for WC, BMI, weight, WHR, and hip circumference, respectively [13]. As there are no WC cut-off points for Australian Aboriginals, we categorised WC into gender-specific quartiles for the analysis and presented a range for WC (65–115 cm) and age (25–65 years) for the prediction to enable easy use of the information from this study. Age has also been a commonly used single risk factor for detecting undiagnosed diabetes, more importantly, when used in addition to one or more risk factors such as obesity, family history of diabetes and hypertension, has the capacity to identify more individuals with undiagnosed diabetes [27]. An Australian study assessed the relationship of increasing prevalence of diabetes with population ageing and obesity [28]. They considered age group and BMI classification, and found that the greatest relative percentage increases over time were observed among those with normal BMI aged 60 years or older (148%), and those who were obese and less than 60 years of age (139%). While BMI is mostly widely used in Australia, very few studies give reports of WC measured.

A previous Australian diabetes-prediction tool (Australian type 2 diabetes risk assessment tool- AUSDRISK) identified WC, age and ethnicity as risk factors in the prediction of incident diabetes [18, 19]. However, Aboriginals in the AUSDRISK were grouped with Southern Europeans and Asians to generate a high-risk group which does not reflect a true representation of the level of diabetic risk among Aboriginals in Australia. Therefore, the validity and applicability of the tool to Aboriginals in Australia is questionable as they were derived from populations with different risk-factor profiles and ethnicities. The uniqueness of our study lies on our focus on one Aboriginal community; to estimate how the diabetes risk varies according to WC and age values, both have been reported as predictors of diabetes [13, 29].

In our study, the lowest T2D incidence was observed among persons in the lowest WC quartile, and we observed the strongest relationship between WC and T2D in the highest WC quartile. There was statistical significant association between WC and diabetes for both males and females in this population. Our estimates of cumulative incidence in Fig 1 suggest a high incidence of diabetes with high WC particularly among females (37.5%). Based on point estimates, our findings revealed females had higher WC values, and were at higher risk of T2D with increasing WC compared to males. The interaction terms incorporated among the variables used showed no statistical significance. A potential reason for this could be our relatively small sample size resulting in insufficient power to our study in detecting the interactions.

Strengths and limitations
Our study has a number of strengths. First, to our knowledge, this is the first diabetes prediction model specifically developed for an Aboriginal population in Australia. We focused on Aboriginals in a remote Aboriginal community where they were culturally homogenous (>80% ascertainment of the population). Also focusing on one Aboriginal community minimised the impact of heterogeneity in body habitus, as epidemiological studies on WC in the indigenous population of Australia have shown that there is substantial variation across communities [11]. Second, the prospective study design used minimised systematic error introduced by the recall bias that cross-sectional and case-control studies are subject to. With a follow-up period of up to 20 years with high participation and follow-up rates, there was a robust ascertainment of diabetes events.

A few limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. First, T2D was only ascertained through recording of a T2D diagnosis reported among the diagnoses for a hospitalization episode. It is likely that some people with diabetes were not hospitalised in the community during the study period, so the absolute risk presented in this study could underestimate the true risk in the population. Second, data on other important risk factors of diabetes such as physical activities, diet and family history of diabetes were not available. Therefore, we could only analyse on data available to us (age, WC, smoking, gender, alcohol consumption) in our analysis. Potential confounding effects of other variables (physical activities, family history of diabetes and diet) were not adjusted in the reported strong association between WC and diabetes risk in this study. Third, since our data were from one community, we were unable to generalise our findings about WC-associated absolute risks of T2D in other Australian Aboriginal communities. Due to our relatively small sample size (803 participants and 110 newly developed T2D), we could not assess internal validation by using subset of individuals from the study sample. However, our findings can be further replicated in other Aboriginal communities to assess the generalizability of our findings. Fourth, there may have been inaccuracies of WC measurements at baseline, resulting in the misclassification of participants into WC quartiles and attenuating the observed associations for WC. Finally, the nature of survival analysis with different follow-up time periods for different participants did not permit the calibration of our predicted risks. However, we have shown the gender-specific cumulative incidence for the WC quartiles to observe the proportion of individuals who had diabetes in the follow-up period according to WC quartiles."
Comparison of Different Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Diabetic Kidney Disease,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), one of the complications of diabetes in patients, leads to progressive loss of kidney function. Timely intervention is known to improve outcomes. Therefore, screening patients to identify high-risk populations is important. Machine learning classification techniques can be applied to patient datasets to identify high-risk patients by building a predictive model.

Objective: This study aims to identify a suitable classification technique for predicting DKD by applying different classification techniques to a DKD dataset and comparing their performance using WEKA machine learning software.

Methods: The performance of nine different classification techniques was analyzed on a DKD dataset with 410 instances and 18 attributes. Data preprocessing was carried out using the PartitionMembershipFilter. A 10-fold cross validation was performed on the dataset. The performance was assessed on the basis of the execution time, accuracy, correctly and incorrectly classified instances, kappa statistics (K), mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and true values of the confusion matrix.

Results: With an accuracy of 93.6585% and a higher K value (0.8731), IBK and random tree classification techniques were found to be the best performing techniques. Moreover, they also exhibited the lowest root mean squared error rate (0.2496). There were 15 false-positive instances and 11 false-negative instances with these prediction models.","Many studies have reported different classifiers for the prediction of DKD. A probabilistic neural network method was found to provide better classification and prediction performance in determining the stages of DKD [23]. BayesNet and REP tree algorithms showed accurate performance in the prediction of chronic kidney disease [24]. However, in another study, J48 was found to be suitable for screening DKD [20]. The gradient boosting classifier was the accurate method in the detection of DKD with the least number of predictors [25]. C4.5 classifier efficiently predicted chronic kidney disease from a high-dimensional dataset [26]. A review found that many researchers have used KNN, ANN, Naïve Bays, SVM, and decision tree (J48, C4.5) for a prediction of chronic kidney disease from the given dataset. The highly accurate classifier was SVM (98.5%), and the least accurate was the Bayes network (57.5%) [27].

The AdaBoost classifier algorithm was found to be highly accurate (0.917) for the prediction of diabetic nephropathy in a dataset of 884 patients and 70 attributes. When the attributes were decreased to the top 5 only, the performance was not affected [28]. Our results show that IBK and random tree classifiers with a dataset of 410 patients and 18 attributes achieved an accuracy of 93.6585%. A systematic review on machine learning methods for prediction of diabetes complications found that random forest algorithm is the overall best prediction performing classifier [29]. We found that the IBK algorithm is the best prediction performing classifier, in general, IBK means KNN algorithm is one of the best classifiers.

Random forest and simple logistic regression methods were shown to have better performance in the prediction of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes from the ACCORD trial dataset [30]. Pasadana et al. also found the random forest classifier to be the best technique for DKD prediction [31]. Random forest regression was used to build a model with data from real-world electronic medical records to predict future kidney functions accurately and provide clinical decision support [32]. In the present study, based on the performance evaluation of classifiers on the DKD dataset, we found that the IBK and random tree classifiers exhibited the best performance compared to the other classifiers like J48, Naïve Bayes, REP tree, AdaBoostM1, Hoeffding Tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron.

The predictive models can be used in real-life situations when extensive invasive tests are not possible. High-risk patients may be identified using the available dataset. Our predictive model was developed using easily available routine laboratory parameters. Therefore, screening patients to identify those who are vulnerable for developing kidney disease is possible in primary clinics. It will help the clinicians to decide on starting intensive preventive therapy for the high-risk patients."
Knowledge of risk of developing diabetes mellitus among siblings of Type 2 diabetic patients,"We set out to investigate the extent to which siblings of diabetic subjects perceived themselves likely to develop Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) when offered screening tests.

Methods: Nondiabetic siblings, aged 35-74 years, of Type 2 diabetic patients who were more than 35 years old at diagnosis had fasting plasma glucose measured in a study to determine heritability of diabetes. Questionnaires assessing perceived likelihood of developing, seriousness and knowledge about diabetes were completed. Logistic regression assessed factors predicting perceptions of diabetes risk.

Results: Factors predicting diabetes on screening were male sex, increasing age and body mass index (BMI) > or = 30. Eighty-nine per cent of 540 eligible siblings completed questionnaires. Thirty-eight per cent saw themselves at increased risk of diabetes and 34% thought diabetes a serious problem. Predictors of perceiving an increased likelihood of developing diabetes were female sex, age 35-54 years vs. 55-74 years and having a parent with diabetes. BMI did not affect perceptions of likelihood.",A perception of reduced vulnerability to diabetes may occur due to unawareness of risk or minimization of risk. Feelings of invulnerability may affect emotional response to a subsequent result. It is not known whether providing more information about the risk of developing diabetes prior to screening would affect outcomes
Effect of diabetes mellitus on female sexual function and risk factors,"The study was conducted to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus upon female sexual function, and to detect possible risk factors that might predict sexual dysfunction. The study consisted of 127 married women: 21 women with type 1 diabetes, 50 women with type 2 diabetes and 56 healthy women as a control. Female sexual functions were evaluated with a questionnaire to assess sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction was 71% in the type 1 diabetic group, 42% in the type 2 diabetic group and 37% in the control subjects. The scores for sexual desire, arousal and lubrication were significantly lower in the type 1 diabetes group than in the control subjects (p < 0.05). The scores of orgasm, satisfaction, dyspareunia and total sexual function were slightly lower in the type 1 diabetic group than in the other groups. No factor predicted sexual dysfunction in the diabetic women while further age, poor education, absence of occupation and menopause predicted sexual dysfunction in the control subjects. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction was significantly higher in the type 1 diabetic women than in the type 2 diabetics and control subjects. However, no risk factors that might cause sexual dysfunction could be predicted in diabetic women.",
A risk score for predicting incident diabetes in the Thai population,"The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a risk score to predict people at high risk of diabetes in Thailand.

Research design and methods: A Thai cohort of 2,677 individuals, aged 35-55 years, without diabetes at baseline, was resurveyed after 12 years. Logistic regression models were used to identify baseline risk factors that predicted the incidence of diabetes; a simple model that included only those risk factors as significant (P < 0.05) when adjusted for each other was developed. The coefficients from this model were transformed into components of a diabetes score. This score was tested in a Thai validation cohort of a different 2,420 individuals.

Results: A total of 361 individuals developed type 2 diabetes in the exploratory cohort during the follow-up period. The significant predictive variables in the simple model were age, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, and history of diabetes in parents or siblings A cutoff score of 6 of 17 produced the optimal sum of sensitivity (77%) and specificity (60%). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.74. Adding impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance status to the model slightly increased the AUC to 0.78; adding low HDL cholesterol and/or high triglycerides barely improved the model. The validation cohort demonstrated similar results.","In the present study we develop a practical tool for prediction of diabetes incidence in Thailand. The variables included are age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, history of hypertension, and history of diabetes in parents or siblings. The simple model without laboratory tests is almost as good as models that include IFG, glucose intolerance, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides. The simple model is attractive because it is noninvasive, more convenient, and less expensive compared with the models that rely upon blood tests. The scoring rule based on the simple model performed well when it was validated in an independent cohort. The risk score method for identifying high-risk people is practical for a primary medical care setting and for a layperson to perform self-assessment. The high-risk individuals identified will benefit from receiving health education and having the opportunity to engage in healthy lifestyles at an early stage so as to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. It is generally recommended that individuals with high risk have a fasting blood test, and, nowadays, the test is available in most primary health care settings in Thailand. Combining the information on IFG with the simple diabetes risk score increased the predictive ability in the validation cohort. This might indicate that IFG is an influential predictor in populations with a high prevalence of IFG.

Other risk scores have been developed elsewhere, but few were developed from a cohort study design in which incident rather than prevalent cases were used. Among those with a cohort design, virtually all were developed in Caucasians and contain variables that may not be readily available in other populations. For instance, the Finnish diabetes risk model (10) requires knowledge of a history of high blood glucose. The model by Stern et al. (11) includes biochemical data on blood glucose, total and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The inclusion of blood test data might not be practical in countries such as Thailand, where health care resources are limited, and such tests are not easily affordable. However, the current study lacks information on certain easily measurable risk factors that may be important predictors of diabetes, such as physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Results are given for both sexes combined, because of the small number of events among women (67 in the exploratory cohort and 27 in the validation cohort). This, unfortunately, precludes the chance to investigate potentially important sex differences in the optimum risk score.

Among the modifiable risk factors that played a substantial role in previous studies was obesity, measured by BMI or waist circumference. In the present study, both BMI and waist circumference were found to increase diabetes risk at cutoff points suggested for Asian populations that are lower than those used for people in Western countries (18,19). HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are components of the metabolic syndrome, which is related to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk. We did not find that low HDL cholesterol or high triglyceride levels add more predictive ability than the model with fasting blood glucose or IGT. A recent study showed that a diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome is not superior to a diabetes risk score in the prediction of diabetes (20).

Importantly, this study, unlike many previous ones, included a validation test of the diabetes prediction score in another population. Although the validation cohort was drawn from the same workforce, it contained an entirely different set of individuals drawn from a wider geographical area. The results of the validation confirmed that the risk score performs well in the prediction of diabetes. However, at the score that best defined diabetes in the exploratory cohort, it slightly overestimated the risk of diabetes in the validation set. This result might be due to the shorter follow-up in the validation cohort compared with that for the exploratory cohort. However, some degree of poorer fit is expected, because all scores are more likely to perform well in the study within which they were developed. The optimal score in the validation cohort was only 1 point higher than in the exploratory cohort, further confirming the utility of the score derived here.

The present study provides a risk score based on a specific population in Asia. The predictive performance and discriminative ability of the score is relatively comparable to those developed among Caucasians (10–12). We were unable to validate the Finnish diabetes risk score or other scores with our data because certain information such as physical activity and vegetable or fruit consumption used in those studies was not available in our data. However, one study proved that those score rules yielded low accuracy when applied to another population, probably due to the differences in population characteristics (21). Nevertheless, future researchers might investigate more about the generalizability of these score rules across countries.

In summary, the simple diabetes risk score developed here can be applied in primary medical care practice and by the public as a self-assessment tool to identify people at high risk of diabetes. People with a high score should be referred for further blood tests and changes to a healthier lifestyle for primary prevention."
Risk of hospitalization and healthcare cost associated with Diabetes Complication Severity Index in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database,"The aim of this study is to test the validity of adapted Diabetes Complication Severity Index (aDCSI) in predicting the risk of hospitalization and healthcare cost in type 2 diabetic patients using a nationally-representative claims database.

Study design: Retrospective cohort study used 4years of claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).

Methods: Type 2 diabetic patients who had 4-years of enrollment were identified as study subjects (N=136,372). The aDCSI score (sum of diabetic complication with severity levels, range 0-13) and complication count (sum of diabetic complications, range 0-7) were generated using diagnostic codes for each patient. Poisson model and linear regression model were conducted to predict risk of hospitalization and healthcare costs associated with aDCSI score and count of diabetic complications.

Results: The aDCSI score (risk ratio 1.51 to 10.32 categorically, and 1.41 linearly) and count of diabetic complications (risk ratio 1.56 to 12.20 categorically, and 1.66 linearly) were significantly positively associated with risk of hospitalization. A one-point increase in the aDCSI score was positively associated with increased healthcare costs.

Conclusions: The performance of aDCSI in predicting risk of hospitalization and healthcare cost in the nationally-representative claims database is similar to those reported in the original study. It may serve as an efficient tool for stratifying type 2 diabetic patients for disease management programs and population-based studies.","To our knowledge, our study is the first study to validate the aDCSI and to estimate healthcare costs associated with aDCSI using an external claims database. The generalizability of aDCSI had been expanded to a nationally-representative Asian diabetic population in our study. This may lead to a better understanding of diabetic specific stratification system targeting high-risk patients to ameliorate utilization of medical service.

Our data source was from a nationally-representative claims"
Prediction of cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes,"People with diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially if they have already developed vascular problems. For patients who are apparently free of vascular complications, risk tables are often used to assess the risk of cardiovascular events in the following years, and to decide on treatment with statins or anti-platelet therapy. These risk prediction tables include estimates of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and are based on populations, some of which only contained a very small number of people with diabetes. Multiple problems can be identified with these tables, and many seriously underestimate cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes. Possible ways of addressing this include using risk estimation tools based solely on diabetic populations, adding in additional traditional variables such as triglycerides or left ventricular hypertrophy, including novel cardiovascular risk factors, or intervening at a lower level of estimated risk in people with diabetes compared with non-diabetic subjects. Alternatively, estimates of individual risk could be abandoned and all people with diabetes could be treated with statins and other effective agents.",
Predicting diabetes clinical outcomes using longitudinal risk factor trajectories,"The ubiquity of electronic health records (EHR) offers an opportunity to observe trajectories of laboratory results and vital signs over long periods of time. This study assessed the value of risk factor trajectories available in the electronic health record to predict incident type 2 diabetes.

Study design and methods: Analysis was based on a large 13-year retrospective cohort of 71,545 adult, non-diabetic patients with baseline in 2005 and median follow-up time of 8 years. The trajectories of fasting plasma glucose, lipids, BMI and blood pressure were computed over three time frames (2000-2001, 2002-2003, 2004) before baseline. A novel method, Cumulative Exposure (CE), was developed and evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression to assess risk of incident type 2 diabetes. We used the Framingham Diabetes Risk Scoring (FDRS) Model as control.

Results: The new model outperformed the FDRS Model (.802 vs .660; p-values <2e-16). Cumulative exposure measured over different periods showed that even short episodes of hyperglycemia increase the risk of developing diabetes. Returning to normoglycemia moderates the risk, but does not fully eliminate it. The longer an individual maintains glycemic control after a hyperglycemic episode, the lower the subsequent risk of diabetes.

Conclusion: Incorporating risk factor trajectories substantially increases the ability of clinical decision support risk models to predict onset of type 2 diabetes and provides information about how risk changes over time.","Predictive performance of the models
Our results showed that it is possible to build diabetes risk models with state of the art predictive performance using variables that are commonly available in the electronic health records. Among the four models we constructed, the Baseline model, which is built using diagnoses, medication prescriptions, lab results (lipids and FPG) and vitals (blood pressure and BMI) at baseline, and does not even take trajectories into account, achieved a survival concordance of .767 (±.006). This performance represents a 14% improvement over the performance of the Framingham score (.660 ± .006) and is highly comparable to the performance of state-of-the-art risk models published in a large validation study [7]; thus, the Baseline model can be considered a state-of-the-art model in its own right.

Taking historic information about laboratory results and vital sign into account significantly improves predictive accuracy. The simplest way to incorporate history is to compute the most extreme measurement during the period of 2000–2004. Adding these predictors to the Baseline model results in the Extreme Value model, which has almost 5% higher concordance than the Baseline model (.802 vs .767; p-value < 2.2e-16). Having one historic measurement in 2000–2004 and the most recent measurement for most patients forms a trajectory, albeit a very crude one. The results from the Extreme Value model show that incorporating any trajectory information is very beneficial; even this crude representation of a trajectory brought almost half as much improvement as adding all the predictors to the Framingham score that the Baseline model has.

Finally, the cumulative exposure variables refined the notion of trajectories, further improving the performance to .805 (±.005). This improvement is important because it represents a substantial difference in certain subpopulations. The key difference between the Extreme Model and the Cumulative Exposure model is granularity, which gives us two pieces of information: (i) the time frame in which the extreme value occurred, and (ii) whether or not the patient was normal in other time frames. The cumulative exposure model opens up a temporal dimension, allowing us to directly model situations where patients can have intermittent abnormal laboratory results, and are brought back under control through (say) lifestyle changes. The Cumulative Exposure achieved higher predictive ability to assess the risk of diabetes in patients who had prediabetes at some point in the past than the Baseline or the Extreme Values model.

Importance of incorporating trajectories
Not only does incorporating trajectories through the Cumulative Exposure variables improve predictive performance, it also improves our understanding of diabetes. While many of the metabolic risk factors of diabetes are well known, [14, 19] their temporal behavior is not.

We have demonstrated through the use of the cumulative exposure model that even episodic (short-term; no more than 2–3 years of) prediabetes increases the risk of developing overt diabetes, and that returning to normoglycemia mitigates this risk, but does not fully eliminate it. We could not find any evidence in the literature indicating whether or not returning to normoglycemia eliminates the increase in risk possibly caused by previous prediabetes, it is well understood that prediabetic patients face an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and it is also known that sustained successful intervention either via lifestyle change or pharmacological intervention can delay the onset of diabetes by 4–5 years [1, 2].

Moreover, our results also suggest that the longer a patient remains normoglycemic after an episode of hyperglycemia, the lower the risk of developing diabetes. Our results suggest that temporarily returning to normoglycemia between two episodes of hyperglycemia has a positive effect on mitigating the risk of developing diabetes.

Obesity trajectories
While we did not perform a subpopulation analysis specifically for obese patients, the coefficients of the Cumulative Exposure model suggest that an analogous relationship exists between BMI and obesity. Becoming obese even for a short period of time increases the patient’s risk of developing overt type 2 diabetes and losing weight thereafter mitigates this risk. Similar to prediabetes, the effect of previous short-term obesity is attenuated over time: the longer the patient has been non-obese, the lower the effect of any previous incidence of obesity. After 5 years, the effect of previous obesity appears to lose any significant effect. This observation requires a cautionary statement. When exactly the effect becomes insignificant depends on the sample size, thus the 5-year period we observed in our sample may be a statistical artifact, but the attenuation in the effect size is not. In other words, in a larger cohort, 2000–2001 BMI could have been statistically significant, but we expect its effect size to be smaller than the effect size in 2002–2003.

Metabolic memory
In the context of progression from diabetes to its complications, the concept of metabolic memory of glucose control has been proposed. Several studies have shown that better early glycemic control has enduring effect that persists over time [20]. For example, in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), patients with type 1 diabetes were randomized to intensive or standard insulin regimens to control their blood sugars [21]. Because the group in the intensive arm achieved profound reductions in the rate of microvascular complications, the trial was stopped early and all patients were switched to intensive therapy. In a follow up trial with this same population (EDIC trial) it was found that those initially assigned to the intensive arm continued to have lower incidence of complications despite the fact that both groups had subsequently achieved similar glycemic control for several years after switching to the intensive therapy [22]. In other words, initial better glucose control has sustained long-term benefits.

Our study presents a complementary but compatible viewpoint. We found that even short-term loss of control can result in long-term disadvantages. Exposure to hyperglycemia also has “memory”: elevated FPG in the past continues to increase risk of diabetes in the future despite having achieved similar control (returning to normoglycemia). However, our study also suggests that this memory fades over time. Returning to normoglycemia attenuates the negative effect of prior exposure. Our findings are compatible with previous findings in the sense that among patients with similar control (normoglycemic at baseline), achieving better control (return to normoglycemia earlier) has future benefits.

Although the UKPDS blood pressure control trial failed to demonstrate “memory” for blood pressure, we found that cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure was significant for the most recent timeframe [23]. This could be due to loss of power, since patients with missing blood pressure measurement during 2000–2004 were included, while patients with similarly missing glucose were excluded.

Limitations
Our study cohort was defined so that patients have multiple FPG measurements; however, other laboratory results and vital signs could be missing. Specifically, there are 2200 patients who have no blood pressure measurements and 1600 patients who have no lipid measurements during the entire period of 2000–2004. The lack of statistical significance of lipid trajectories may be due to the lower statistical power of these variables. These results are only applicable to health care provided in the ambulatory care setting, specifically, primary care, and using fasting plasma glucose measurements.

This is a single center study, with limited racial variability; therefore, the effect of race could not be incorporated. Social history and family history was available only for a limited number of patients. The study was based on EHR data. As such, non-pharmacological interventions, such as lifestyle changes, were not consistently documented."
Screening for diabetes: sensitivity and positive predictive value of risk factor total,"Screening for diabetes is recommended for individuals > or =45 years of age, or earlier if they manifest > or = one specific risk factors. This study examined the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of risk factor total for identifying individuals with diabetes and prediabetes.

Design: Subjects were interviewed to assess the presence of risk factors. Fasting plasma glucose levels were obtained.

Setting: The study occurred at a health fair in Greensburg, PA.

Patients: Six hundred sixty-one Caucasians between the ages of 19 and 100.

Results: Using the criterion of screening individuals with > or = one risk factors detected 100% of both diabetics and prediabetics. This dropped to 91.2% when screening individuals with > or = two factors. The PPV of the risk factor total was poor (80% of individuals with a total of four factors were not diabetic). The ability of the risk factor total to predict individuals with impaired glucose metabolism (prediabetics + diabetics) was considerably better, and increased almost linearly with the risk factor total. Of the subjects with normal glucose values, the mean glucose increased as the risk factor total increased.

Conclusion: While the sensitivity of using > one risk factor as an algorithm to screen is 100% for identifying diabetics, the PPV of risk factor analysis for identifying diabetics is poor. The same algorithm works well to identify at-risk individuals, presumably allowing early intervention and education.",
Comparative accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction methods in patients with diabetes mellitus,"To compare the accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction methods based on equations derived from the Framingham Heart Study in a cohort of patients with diabetes mellitus.

Research design and methods  Risk factor data was collected prospectively from 906 patients with diabetes mellitus. Absolute cardiovascular risks were calculated using the Framingham equation, and estimated with the currently available Framingham-based risk tables and charts. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the tables and charts to assess cardiovascular risk were assessed using calculation of risk from the full Framingham equation as the reference method.

Results  In all, 146 subjects (16.1%) had calculated 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risks ≥ 30%, and 585 (64.6%) had risks ≥ 15%. For identification of those at 10-year CHD risk ≥ 30%, the original Sheffield tables had a sensitivity of 43% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 19.9–61.7%) and specificity of 94% (CI 90.8–96.7%). Modifications of the Sheffield tables improve sensitivity (95% CI 93.9–97%) but reduce specificity (90% CI 85.6–95.7%). The Joint British Guidelines' charts have a moderate sensitivity (69.5% CI 51.8–81.9%) and high specificity (99.7% CI 98.9–100%). For identification of individuals at a 10-year CHD risk ≥ 27%, the Framingham categorical tables had a sensitivity of 95% (CI 91.6–97.8%), but a specificity of only 83% (95% CI 79.1–85.5%).
","The Joint British charts appear to have the best performance in a cohort of patients with diabetes mellitus, however, calculation of CHD/CVD (cardiovascular disease) risks with personal or laboratory computers using the full Framingham equation remains the most accurate way to assess cardiovascular risk in a primary prevention setting."
T1DMicro: A Clinical Risk Calculator for Type 1 Diabetes Related Microvascular Complications,"Development of complications in type 1 diabetes patients can be reduced by modifying risk factors. We used a cross-sectional cohort of 1646 patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to develop a clinical risk score for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), autonomic neuropathy (AN), retinopathy (DR), and nephropathy (DN). Of these patients, 199 (12.1%) had DPN, 63 (3.8%) had AN, 244 (14.9%) had DR, and 88 (5.4%) had DN. We selected five variables to include in each of the four microvascular complications risk models: age, age of T1D diagnosis, duration of T1D, and average systolic blood pressure and HbA1C over the last three clinic visits. These variables were selected for their strong evidence of association with diabetic complications in the literature and because they are modifiable risk factors. We found the optimism-corrected R2 and Harrell's C statistic were 0.39 and 0.87 for DPN, 0.24 and 0.86 for AN, 0.49 and 0.91 for DR, and 0.22 and 0.83 for DN, respectively. This tool was built to help inform patients of their current risk of microvascular complications and to motivate patients to control their HbA1c and systolic blood pressure in order to reduce their risk of these complications.","While the DCCT trial and numerous other studies have shown the importance of HbA1C levels in the risk of diabetic complications [8,9], our cross-sectional cohort had no association between any of the four diabetic complications and average HbA1c, maximum HbA1c, standard deviation of HbA1c, or most recent HbA1c on univariate analysis (Table 2). However, average HbA1c was a significant contributor in the multivariate logistic regression models (Figure 1), suggesting that HbA1c is important in the context of age and age at T1D diagnosis. Additionally, while the DCCT clinical trial compared glucose control through HbA1c in separate arms, our cross-sectional non-interventional cohort has lower HbA1c values on average and the HbA1c values were more closely distributed (Table 1). Additionally, we did not identify an association between smoking status and microvascular complications. It is possible that our patient population under-reported smoking or that the lack of pack years in our analysis led to the lack of statistical significance.

Most of the results from the univariate risk models agree with previous reports of risk factors for complications (Table 2). Similar to previous reports, we found a significant association between blood pressure, hypertension, and the four diabetic complications [14]. We found that dyslipidemia was associated with diabetic complications [34]. Females were more likely to have DPN and DR than males were, consistent with previous studies [35]. We found that the association between microvascular complication and onset of T1D peaked around age 20. This is slightly older than the reported increased microvascular complication risk with T1D onset around puberty [11], but this may reflect a skew present in our cross-sectional cohort. Contrary to previous reports, we did not find any association between total cholesterol and diabetic complication risk [36]. This difference in association between these cohorts is potentially due to the different populations studied.

We showed that the presence of one diabetic complication is strongly associated with having other diabetic complications (Table 2). This observation suggests that similar clinical variables may be used to predict multiple diabetic complications. Our models support this hypothesis since a logistic regression model including age, age at T1D diagnosis, average SBP, and average HbA1c performed well (Figure 1) with optimism-corrected R2 and Harrell’s C statistics 0.39 and 0.87 for DPN, 0.24 and 0.86 for AN, 0.49 and 0.91 for DR, and 0.22 and 0.83 for DN, respectively. This compares favorably to previously reported models [16,17,18,19,20] in terms of discrimination and calibration with the advantage of improved model simplicity and interpretability.

While other variables have been associated with T1D complications and applied in other risk models, we wanted to minimize the number of variables patients or clinicians need to identify to calculate complication risks. Namely, we did not include body mass index, triglycerides, or diastolic blood pressure [34]. Model simplicity might sacrifice the model’s discriminatory and calibration properties, but we have demonstrated that our models are comparable to previously reported models.

One of the limitations of this study is its cross-sectional nature. This does not allow for temporal analyses which can help to establish causation; for example, we are not able to discern if use of a statin or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is associated with complications directly or via the diagnosis leading to use of the medication. The cross-sectional design also means we were unable to update our data with changes in diagnoses of complications, so our study likely underestimates the rates of diabetic microvascular complications. While we were able to address our models’ accuracy and calibration, validation is still required to establish generalizability. A third limitation due to the cross-sectional design is that the management of T1D including medications and screening for complications has invariably changed since patient recruitment ended in 2010, and we are not able to account for possible effects this might have had in predicting T1D complications.

Outside the above limitations owing to the cross-sectional design, the study population was entirely Caucasian. Although non-Hispanic Caucasians have the highest rate of T1D in the U.S., an estimated 23% of T1D is outside this demographic [37,38]. Thus, it is possible that the results of our models are not generalizable to the entire T1D population. An additional limitation to generalizability is that we have not yet externally validated our models in an independent population, only via bootstrapping. Since the microvascular complication data were obtained from an electronic health record and not through regular screening, we would expect the complications to be underdiagnosed. Indeed, our calibration plots do all indicate the models predict a higher rate of diabetic complications compared with the training data.

We emphasize the important role of the modifiable factors HbA1c and SBP in the risk of developing microvascular complications (Figure 2) and of informing patients of the potential reductions in risk associated with decreases in HbA1c and SBP. We hope this risk calculator becomes a useful tool for clinicians and patients and helps motivate patients to modify their risk factors for diabetic complications (https://ptran25.shinyapps.io/Diabetic_Peripheral_Neuropathy_Risk, (accessed on 14 October 2021)). The risk calculator is not intended to replace or support clinician diagnosis of microvascular complications. It is merely a tool to augment lifestyle counseling."
A simplified Finnish diabetes risk score to predict type 2 diabetes risk and disease evolution in a German population,"The FINDRISC questionnaire is a screening tool to estimate the risks for type 2 diabetes as well as asymptomatic type 2 diabetes. We aimed to evaluate its performance to predict diabetes in a German population and to compare its predictive and detective ability in the same population.

Methods: A total of 552 subjects with increased risk of type 2 diabetes were investigated. All individuals completed the FINDRISC questionnaires and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All individuals were followed for 3 years and underwent an OGTT again. The performance of the opportunistic screening was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). An intervention program was carried out for all diabetic and IFG/IGT patients at baseline.

Results: For identification, the asymptomatic type 2 DM was named Condition 1; prediction of type 2 DM risk in the follow-up survey as Condition 2; and diabetes risk predicting in a hypothetical case of survey without intervention program as Condition 3. The ROC-AUC in the three condition were AUC (FINDRISC1)=0.745, AUC (FINDRISC2)=0.789, and AUC (FINDRISC3)=0.775, respectively. A significant association between FINDRISC and evolution of disease was found, but the variation of plasma glucose during the three years follow-up was not associated with FINDRISC. People in the intervention group with an improvement of glucose tolerance had a smaller FINDRISC score than persons with an unchanged or progressive condition of disease.",FINDRISC was validated in our study as a simple tool with high performance to predict diabetes risk and less efficient to identify asymptomatic type 2 diabetes. People with lower FINDRISC score will benefit easier from preventive intervention.
Can deep learning on retinal images augment known risk factors for cardiovascular disease prediction in diabetes? A prospective cohort study from the national screening programme in Scotland,"Aims
This study’s objective was to evaluate whether deep learning (DL) on retinal photographs from a diabetic retinopathy screening programme improve prediction of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods
DL models were trained to jointly predict future CVD risk and CVD risk factors and used to output a DL score. Poisson regression models including clinical risk factors with and without a DL score were fitted to study cohorts with 2,072 and 38,730 incident CVD events in type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) respectively.

Results
DL scores were independently associated with incident CVD with adjusted standardised incidence rate ratios of 1.14 (P = 3 × 10−04 95 % CI (1.06, 1.23)) and 1.16 (P = 4 × 10−33 95 % CI (1.13, 1.18)) in T1DM and T2DM cohorts respectively. The differences in predictive performance between models with and without a DL score were statistically significant (differences in test log-likelihood 6.7 and 51.1 natural log units) but the increments in C-statistics from 0.820 to 0.822 and from 0.709 to 0.711 for T1DM and T2DM respectively, were small.

Conclusions
These results show that in people with diabetes, retinal photographs contain information on future CVD risk. However for this to contribute appreciably to clinical prediction of CVD further approaches, including exploitation of serial images, need to be evaluated.","We have shown that though DL scores are predictive of CVD in models with age, sex, and duration only, the increment in predictive performance when adding DL scores to a model with other clinical risk factors is small, although statistically significant. Stratification by age and sex did not show any subgroup in which the increment in predictive performance was larger.

Our findings are consistent with previous studies. Poplin et al. [6] compared both the SCORE risk prediction model and a restricted prediction model including age, sex, BMI, SBP and smoking status for prediction of 5 year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the UK Biobank (UKBB) cohort to models that included dl-based predictions from fundus images. They showed no evidence of predictive improvement over SCORE by including DL predictions. Inclusion of DL predictions to their restricted model yielded a small increase in C-statistic from 0.72 to 0.73. Only 5 % of UKBB participants in the study had diabetes, whereas our study evaluated prediction in T1DM and T2DM cohorts. Since in diabetes the pathogenesis of CVD and retinopathy are partly shared (both being strongly influenced by glycaemia and blood pressure) we may expect that DL from fundus images are more predictive in diabetes cohorts. However we do not find evidence for this.

Readers may be surprised that the predictive performance of CVD risk models is relatively modest: even in T1DM, the best models have a C-statistic of only about 0.8, equivalent to information for discrimination, Λ, of only 1.0 bit. However, this is within the range that we would expect, given that CVD risk is determined by a relatively small number of independent risk factors of modest effect size. For established CVD risk factors such as blood cholesterol the rate ratio associated with increment of one standard deviation of a single risk factor is typically about 1.5, which corresponds approximately to an increment of 0.12 bits in Λ, or an increment from a baseline model with C-statistic of 0.75 (equivalent to Λ of 0.66 bits) to a C-statistic of 0.77. Thus even what are regarded as strong risk factors of CVD only provide a modest increment to prediction of CVD risk. For weaker risk factors with standardised rate ratios of 1.2 the approximate increment in Λ is even smaller (0.02 bits) and the typical C-statistic after inclusion of this risk factor would still only be 0.75. For stronger risk factors with standardised rate ratios of 2.5 (increment of 0.61 bits) it would be from 0.75 to 0.83. Increments in C-statistic are not easily interpretable and so our paper uses increments in Λ. Information in retinal images relevant to CVD prediction is, in part, already captured by other risk factors and so, after adjustment for these risk factors, the standardised rate ratios for CVD DLP are similar to smoking status. A good clinical predictor may have a Λ of 3.0 bits (approximately a C-statistic of 0.93) [20]. Given our full baseline model for T1DM a single independent risk factor would require at least an Λ of 1.74 bits corresponding to a standardised rate ratio of 4.7, well above that of many risk factors including CVD DLP.

A major contribution of our analysis is that it has focused on diabetes, had a large sample size and a large number of incident events. To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the performance of DL models using fundus images applied to CVD risk in such cohorts. This study has been informed by the IJMI checklist [22]. There are limitations to our study. We used only one image at entry whereas serial images are available from SDRS. A series of images may be more informative for DL prediction. For instance, monitoring of changes and their location (via image registration) may be more informative than is possible with a single fundus image. Second, our DL models were trained to predict incident CVD and just three CVD risk factors. This is similar to previous studies that trained DL models to predict multiple CVD risk factors simultaneously [6]. In this study it is an example of multi-task learning where the CVD risk factors take the role of related auxiliary tasks to aid training of the primary task [23]. If tasks are similar but with independent signal noise, then learning the tasks jointly can increase the effective sample size due to the combined information in all tasks [24]. However, training against other CVD risk factors may lead to DL models which improve the overall predictive performance of CVD. Thirdly, the removal of ungradable images meant that the gradability of retinal images, which may be affected by ocular opacity, was not taken into account although there are known links between cataract and CVD [25]. We do not externally validate our models in this study, although we did not find evidence that improvements in prediction of CVD using DLPs were large enough to necessitate it at this time. Finally improvements to DL architecture within a similar DL pipeline to our own may provide performance improvements, but we expect they would not produce the standardised rate ratio we state above.

There has been much optimism about the improvement DL using fundus images might make to risk prediction of complications of diabetes such as CVD [26]. Our findings suggest that although there is information relevant to CVD within fundus images increment in prediction for decision making is modest. However, small improvements in predictive performance of models may still be relevant for clinical trial cohort enrichment [27]. In this setting small improvements may substantially reduce the numbers who have to be randomized for the study design to have adequate statistical power."
Predicting macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes: the Japan Diabetes Complications Study/the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial risk engine,"To develop and validate a risk engine that calculates the risks of macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We analyzed pooled data from two clinical trials on 1,748 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients without diabetes complications other than mild diabetic retinopathy with a median follow-up of 7.2 years. End points were coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, noncardiovascular mortality, overt nephropathy defined by persistent proteinuria, and progression of retinopathy. We fit a multistate Cox regression model to derive an algorithm for prediction. The predictive accuracy of the calculated 5-year risks was cross-validated.

RESULTS
Sex, age, HbA1c, years after diagnosis, BMI, systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, atrial fibrillation, current smoker, and leisure-time physical activity were risk factors for macro- and microvascular complications and were incorporated into the risk engine. The observed-to-predicted (O/P) ratios for each event were between 0.93 and 1.08, and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests showed no significant deviations between observed and predicted events. In contrast, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine overestimated CHD risk (O/P ratios: 0.30 for CHD and 0.72 for stroke). C statistics in our Japanese patients were high for CHD, noncardiovascular mortality, and overt nephropathy (0.725, 0.696, and 0.767) but moderate for stroke and progression of retinopathy (0.636 and 0.614). By combining macro- and microvascular risks, the classification of low- and high-risk patients was improved by a net reclassification improvement of 5.7% (P = 0.02).

CONCLUSIONS
The risk engine accurately predicts macro- and microvascular complications and would provide helpful information in risk classification and health economic simulations.","In this study, we developed a novel risk engine that integrates modifiable lifestyle and clinical risk factors, including HbA1c, BMI, SBP, NHDL-C, current smoking, and LTPA into the risks of a first occurrence of macro- and microvascular complications. We confirmed that the risk engine performed reasonably well and that combining macro- and microvascular risks improved the classification of low-risk and high-risk patients by a net reclassification improvement of 5.7%. In contrast, the UKPDS risk engine overestimated CHD risk, and this tendency is consistent with a previous report in Asian patients (18). A web application for the JJ risk engine, which works in both Windows and Macintosh environments, is available at http://www.biostatistics.jp/prediction/jjre.

With the advent of modern therapeutics, especially hypoglycemic and antihypertensive agents, the early identification of high-risk patients is an appealing strategy (35). A novelty of the JJ risk engine is that it allows risk classification based on the risk not only of CVD but also of renal and eye diseases. Although the prevalence of micro- or macroalbuminuria in Asian hypertensive diabetes is alarmingly high (36), most of the progression to overt nephropathy occurs in a small fraction of patients with elevated HbA1c and SBP values and a smoking habit (12). In this study, patients in the fourth quartile of the calculated risk developed overt nephropathy at a rate 10 times greater than those in the first quartile. Most risk engines are specific to CVD; however, greater emphasis on the risk of microvascular diseases should be placed when assessing risk among diabetic patients given that diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are major causes of ESRD and blindness, respectively. Combining macro- and microvascular risks resulted in the net reclassification improvement of 5.7% (P = 0.02) and a sensitivity and specificity of 46.3 and 75.4%, respectively; only 16.5% of cases were classified as the high-risk population for macro- and microvascular diseases and only 43.8% of noncases were in the low-risk population (Table 4). Thus, the discriminatory power of the JJ risk engine was only moderate, despite the statistically significant improvement in prediction, and exploring novel risk factors would be of particular importance for more accurate risk classification.

The JJ risk engine shares features similar to those with previously developed risk engines. The predictors of CHD are the same as in the UKPDS risk engine (5) except for the inclusion of NHDL-C instead of the total cholesterol–to-HDL cholesterol ratio. Donnan et al. (7) added diabetes duration, treated hypertension, height, and two interaction terms into their model, and the risk equation of the HKDR includes diabetes duration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and ACR additionally but does not use HbA1c (18). A recent cohort study in Japan also suggested that the progression of the albuminuria stage is a risk factor of CVD (37). In contrast, log ACR was not associated with CHD or stroke in our study. This discordant observation would be attributable to the exclusion of low microalbuminuria in our study. The elevation of ACR within a range of normoalbuminuria may not lead to an increase in the risk of CVD. We also found that the UKPDS risk engine overestimated CHD risk (Table 2) and the C statistic of the JJ risk engine (0.725) was slightly higher than that of the risk equation of the HKDR (0.704) (18), indicating that the JJ risk engine may outperform the previously developed risk engines for the prediction of CHD. For the prediction of stroke, we did not identify smoking status and years after diagnosis as predictors, which are included in the UKPDS risk engine (6). The risk equation from the Swedish National Diabetes Register incorporates the use of antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering drugs as predictors (9). However, medical therapies are not considered in the current analysis, since the effects of medications on vascular complications were likely to be confounded by other clinical factors. In contrast to CHD, the C statistic of the JJ risk engine (0.636) was similar to the UKPDS risk engine (0.638) and lower than the risk equation of the HKDR (0.749) (17). With regard to lifestyle factors, we identified LTPA as a risk factor for stroke and noncardiovascular mortality, although the statistical significance was borderline. On the other hand, BMI, which has been recognized as one of the most important risk factors in the deterioration of type 2 diabetes, was not associated with CVD. We previously reported that the BMI of Japanese patients is much lower than that of white patients, although in those reports, other patient characteristics were similar in terms of age, HbA1c, and daily energy intake (10,11). Our findings run contrary to the results of studies of white patients, but data on diet in diabetic patients are sparse, particularly in Asia. In this study, the contribution of lifestyle factors to the risk assessment appears to be limited, and the associations between lifestyle and diabetes complications are worthy of further research.

One important feature of this study is that we analyzed pooled data from two nationwide clinical trials in Japan. The end points were defined similarly in both trials and follow-up was performed by diabetes specialists, ensuring data of relatively high quality. Patients generally had fair or good glycemic, weight, blood pressure, and lipid control. The major difference between the two trials was eligible age, i.e., age between 40 and 70 years in the JDCS and age between 65 and 85 years in the J-EDIT. Prior to pooling the datasets, we compared important clinical factors between patients in the two trials and found no notable differences except for age; therefore, pooling of the datasets was considered to be valid. Consequently, the study population in the present analysis included subjects spanning several decades, i.e., those from 40 to 84 years. This can be expected to enhance the generalizability of the algorithm.

Statistical modeling can be much more complex if we handle multiple events simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that applies a multistate model to the construction of a risk engine. It is notable that these events are not inherently independent and the JJ risk engine calculates each probability of the first occurrence for five events. Thus, if the risk of an event (e.g., overt nephropathy) was increased by a risk factor (e.g., log ACR), the probability of the first occurrence of other events (e.g., stroke) can decrease theoretically even if there are no direct associations with the risk factor.

Several limitations warrant mention. First, transportability of prognostic information is critical, but in this study we evaluated only the internal validity. Thus, external validation is required in other populations. Second, updating the algorithm by long-term follow-up data or pooled analysis with other studies in Asia is desirable given that the size of our cohort is relatively small and the observed events of CVD and overt nephropathy in this population were relatively few. Third, we included angina pectoris and transient ischemic attack as components of the cardiovascular events, although they are soft end points. Consequently, the JJ risk engine would provide macrovascular risks higher than those by other risk engines based on only hard cardiovascular events. Fourth, data on peripheral arterial disease and hemoglobin levels were not available. These factors were included as inputs into the HKDR all-cause mortality risk score (19), and peripheral arterial disease is a clinically relevant cardiovascular outcome. Fifth, the use of aspirin, which might increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, was not investigated. Finally, we defined overt nephropathy as the presence of persistent proteinuria, since an elevated urinary albumin excretion due to nondiabetic renal lesions or conditions is not rare.

In conclusion, the risk engine allowed accurate and comprehensive risk assessment of macro- and microvascular complications, although external validation is required in other populations. The calculated absolute risks of vascular complications can be used in risk classification for individual patients, health economic simulations, and estimation of the burden of the disease."
Efficacy Analysis of Team-Based Nursing Compliance in Young and Middle-Aged Diabetes Mellitus Patients Based on Random Forest Algorithm and Logistic Regression,"Long-term hyperglycemia in young and middle-aged diabetic patients can be complicated with diabetic ketoacidosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, infection, and other complications. The objective was to explore the application value of machine learning in predicting the recurrence risk of young and middle-aged diabetes patients with team-based nursing intervention.

Methods
Clinical data of 80 patients with diabetes treated in the Department of Endocrinology from 2019 to 2020 were retrospectively collected. The data set was divided into 70% training set (n =56) and 30% test set (n =24). All the selected research cases were intervened by the team-based management mode involving family and clinical doctors and nurses. The degree of diabetes knowledge learning, the level of blood glucose changes, and the psychological state of the patients were evaluated. The random forest (RF) algorithm and logistic regression prediction model were constructed to predict the risk factors of diabetes recurrence.

Results
There was no significant difference in the degree of diabetes knowledge learning, the level of blood glucose changes, and the psychological state between the training set and the test set (P > 0.05). The FPG, HbA1c, and 2hPG of recurrence group patients were significantly higher than those of nonrecurrence group patients, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In descending order of importance based on the RF algorithm prediction model were glucose, BMI, age, insulin, pedigree function, skin thickness, and blood diastolic pressure. The accuracy of RF and logistic regression prediction models is 81.46% and 80.21%, respectively.

Conclusion
The team-based nursing model has a good effect on the blood glucose control level of middle-aged and young diabetic patients. Age, BMI, and glucose values are risk factors for diabetes. The SF algorithm has a good effect on predicting the risk of diabetes, which is worthy of further clinical application.","Diabetes is one of the most common, rapidly growing, and incurable diseases in the world [16]. In addition to its serious complications, diabetes has been linked to the onset of cancer, cognitive impairment, tuberculosis, and depression [17]. In recent years, large cohort studies in China, the United States, and other countries have found that lifestyle and drug interventions for patients with impaired glucose tolerance and pre-diabetes can delay or even reduce the occurrence of diabetes [18]. The risk of diabetes can be predicted by specific models, and the high risk groups can be found as early as possible, and intervention measures can be implemented to improve the health level of the population.

After team-based nursing model, patients had better understanding of basic knowledge, self-care knowledge, and medical knowledge of diabetes. Patients also scored better on psychological status. In addition, the patient's blood glucose levels were also effectively controlled. These results indicate that team-based nursing model has a good effect on the blood glucose control level of middle-aged and young diabetic patients, which is worthy of promotion of clinical work. The results are similar to previous studies [19].

The number of patients with diabetes and its complications is on the rise [20]. The establishment of a prediction model can help doctors timely diagnose patients' disease and its related indicators, carry out interference, and take corresponding measures. In addition, it can also save medical resources and reduce the pressure on patients and society. As can be seen from the importance of characteristic variables of the RF algorithm model, glucose, BMI, and age are more important. It indicated that people with high blood glucose concentration, obesity, and older age are more likely to suffer from diabetes. Recent studies confirm our conclusions [3, 21]. Casanova et al. established a diabetes risk prediction model using the RF algorithm using 8-year follow-up data of 3 633 African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study. The results showed that glucose, BMI, and age were risk factors for diabetes [3]. The risk of diabetes increases with age and BMI, so people who are older or obese should be vigilant about what they eat. Therefore, in the prevention of diabetes, blood glucose concentration and body mass index should be controlled.

It is a hot topic in the research of diabetes risk prediction in the big data era to establish a simple and accurate diabetes risk prediction model by using a data mining algorithm [22, 23]. In this paper, two kinds of diabetes risk prediction models are constructed based on deep learning, which is an efficient diabetes diagnosis technology emerging in recent years [2, 24–26]. The RF algorithm has high prediction performance, and the influence of abnormal data and noise on the algorithm is very low. The logistic regression model is the most widely used multivariate quantitative analysis method for regression analysis of binary dependent variables, which can have both continuous independent variables and classified independent variables [13].

The focus of diabetes prediction model has gradually shifted from high accuracy to high reliability, so that the prediction method can be applied to different populations. Based on the same data set, different diabetes risk prediction models were constructed, and relevant indicators were included to determine the factors of diabetes occurrence. The results show that the RF algorithm model is significantly higher than the logistic regression prediction model (81.46% and 80.21%, respectively). RF algorithm, as an emerging machine learning algorithm, has robust operation, no requirements on data sets, and no over-fitting. It has been widely used in disease risk assessment [27]. Our results also confirm previous conclusions [28].

There are some limitations to this study. First of all, the patient data included in this study were small and single center. Secondly, insufficient predictive variables included in the prediction model may affect the prediction results."
Clinical utility of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in the prediction of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients,"Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is a method to estimate arterial stiffness, which reflects the stiffness of both the aorta and peripheral artery; it would be applicable to general practice, since its measurementis automated. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether baPWV can be predictors of future cardiovascular events (CVE) in diabetic patients.

Methods
We prospectively evaluated the association between baPWV or carotid intima-media thickness (carotid IMT) at baseline and new onset of CVE in 1040 type 2 diabetic patients without CVE. The predictability of baPWV and/or carotid IMT for identifying patients at high risk for CVE was evaluated by time-dependent receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Results
During a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 113 had new CVD events. The cumulative incidence rates of CVE were significantly higher in patients with high baPWV values (≥1550 cm/s) as compared to those with low baPWV values (<1550 cm/s) (p < 0.001, log-rank test). Similarly, the cumulative incidence rate of CVE was significantly higher in patients with higher maximum carotid IMT (maxIMT) values (≥1.0 mm) as compared to those with lower maxIMT values (<1.0 mm) (p < 0.001, log-rank test). Subjects with both “high PWV” and “high IMT” had a significantly higher risk of developing CVE as compared to those with either “high PWV” or “high IMT,” as well as those with neither. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that both baPWV (HR = 1.30, [95%CI: 1.07-1.57]; p = 0.009) and maxIMT (HR = 1.20, [95%CI: 1.01-1.41]; p = 0.033) were independent predictors for CVE, even after adjustment for the conventional risk factors. Time-dependent ROC curve analyses revealed that the addition of maxIMT to the Framingham risk score resulted in significant increase in AUC (from 0.60 [95%CI: 0.54-0.67] to 0.63 [95%CI: 0.60-0.82]; p = 0.01). Notably, the addition of baPWV to the Framingham risk score and maxIMT resulted in further and significant (p = 0.02) increase in AUC (0.72 [95%CI: 0.67-0.78]).

Conclusions
Evaluation of baPWV, in addition to carotid IMT and conventional risk factors, improved the ability to identify the diabetic individuals with high risk for CVE.","Early detection of asymptomatic severe coronary artery disease as well as cerebrovascular disease, and subsequent rapid intervention, are important to reduce mortality in the management of diabetes. Although cardiovascular risk assessment based on the conventional risk factors is recommended for predicting cardiovascular risk, validation studies have shown that this approach had only moderate performance [1-3]. Therefore, a non-invasive and inexpensive tool to predict the risk of subclinical or silent atherosclerosis with more than moderate predictive ability is required for identifying individuals at high-risk of CVE.

Because baPWV is easy to measure and requires no special techniques, it could be suitable for screening in routine care. It has been already shown that baPWV is closely associated with conventional cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with and without diabetes [34]. The present study also demonstrated that there were significant associations between conventional cardiovascular risk factors and baPWV, suggesting that high baPWV itself reflects inherent cardiovascular risk factors. However, there was insufficient evidence of its clinical significance; although several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that higher baPWV levels were associated with increased risk of CVD or mortality among the general population [11,12,17,18] and high-risk patients with coronary heart disease or renal diseases [35-37], it has been unclear whether baPWV level is associated with increased risk of the development of CVE in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients.

The present study clearly demonstrated that a higher baPWV level was associated with increased risk of development of CVE in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients. Furthermore, a multivariate analysis revealed that baPWV was still an independent predictor for CVE even after adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors. These results were consistent with the findings observed in general populations, and with the idea that diabetic patients with arterial stiffness are prone to develop CVE.

The present study also confirmed the results of several previous studies reporting that carotid IMT, a marker of early atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling, was an independent predictor of CVE in asymptomatic diabetic patients [38-40].

Interestingly, type 2 diabetic subjects with both “high PWV” and “high IMT” had a significantly greater risk of developing CVE compared to those with either “high PWV” or “high IMT”, and to those with neither. Furthermore, a multivariate regression model revealed that both baPWV and maxIMT were significant independent predictors for CVE, even after adjustment for each other and the conventional risk factors. These results suggest that baPWV and maxIMT reflect different aspects of cardiovascular risk that leads to onset of CVE, and that measurement of either or both of these two parameters could substantially improve the risk assessment for future CVE compared with the risk assessment based on conventional cardiovascular risk factors alone.

To test the above hypothesis, the predictability of baPWV and/or maxIMT for identifying patients at high risk for CVE was then evaluated over time. Importantly, measurement of baPWV improved the risk assessment for future CVE when compared with the Framingham Risk Score, which is one of the established risk scores reflecting conventional cardiovascular risk factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that adding baPWV to an established risk score significantly improved the risk assessment for future CVE in type 2 diabetic patients. The question of whether measurement of carotid IMT can add prognostic information beyond conventional cardiovascular risk markers remains controversial [40-44]. However, we confirmed previous findings that the addition of carotid IMT to conventional risk factors could improve the assessment of risk for future CVE, but the improvement of the predictability was small. Interestingly, the AUC of the time-dependent ROC curve was further increased after the addition of baPWV to FRS and maxIMT (from 0.63 to 0.72; p = 0.02). This is the first study to show that evaluation of the baPWV, in addition to carotid IMT and conventional risk factors, further improved the ability to identify individuals with a high risk for CVE. These findings highlight the clinical usefulness of baPWV in the risk assessment of CVE among asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients, suggesting that it can be applied more broadly in routine care in this group.

Several limitations of our study should be discussed. First, the sample size and the number of events were relatively small. Furthermore, there was a gender imbalance among participants. Second, the primary outcome was new onset of all cardiovascular events, including the need for coronary revascularization and PAD (soft events). However, even if we focus on new onset of the major CVE, similar results were obtained. Third, the subjects of this study were Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and were a cohort with relatively low cardiovascular risk. Although the incidence of CVE observed was comparable to the value reported in a previous Japanese study [45], it was notably lower compared to the incidence observed in Western diabetic populations [46,47]. Therefore, it would be premature to generalize our findings to other racial or ethnic groups or non-diabetic subjects. It should be also noted that the definitions of hypertension and dyslipidemia adopted in this study were for Japanese diabetic patients and somewhat different from those used in Western countries (especially in the thresholds of systolic blood pressure and serum LDL cholesterol level). It may reduce comparability of our study with others concerning the same topic, although we confirmed that the results of the analyses were almost the same even if we adopted Western definitions. Fourth, the development of PAD was considered one of the components of primary outcome. However, some asymptomatic PAD cases might have been overlooked, since ankle-brachial indices were not measured annually during the observation period in some cases. Fifth, in some analyses we divided subjects into two groups according to their baPWV values and compared the between-group differences. However, the cut-off value of baPWV used in these analyses was not based on previous literature but used the median value of this cohort. Sixth, the ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC of FRS for predicting risk of CVE in type 2 diabetic patients would be small. However, this was consistent with those of several previous studies, which also showed a value of around 0.60 [48].

The present study focused on the question of whether measurement of baPWV can provide any useful information for identifying patients with a high risk for CVE at a certain point in their life with diabetes. Our thesis would have been strengthened if it were shown that measurement of baPWV could improve the risk prediction of CVE even after adjustment for the therapeutic regimen during the follow-up period. However, the therapeutic regimens (e.g. types of agents administered and duration of administration) used by our study subjects varied greatly and we were not able to include such a wide range of parameters in the multivariate regression model, because the number of observed CVE was insufficient. Therefore, whether the therapeutic regimens used and/or longitudinal monitoring of major cardio-metabolic parameters during follow-up affects the predictability of baPWV should be evaluated in further studies.

Notwithstanding these limitations, our study indicates that measurement of baPWV can provide useful information for identifying patients with a high risk of CVE."
A risk prediction model for heart failure hospitalization in type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Background
Antidiabetic therapies have shown disparate effects on hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in clinical trials. This study developed a prediction model for HHF in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using real world data to identify patients at high risk for HHF.

Hypothesis
Type 2 diabetics at high risk for HHF can be identified using information generated during usual clinical care.

Methods
This electronic medical record‐ (EMR‐) based retrospective cohort study included patients with T2DM free of HF receiving healthcare through a single, large integrated healthcare system. The primary endpoint was HHF, defined as a hospital admission with HF as the primary diagnosis. Cox regression identified the strongest predictors of HHF from 80 candidate predictors derived from EMRs. High risk patients were defined according to the 90th percentile of estimated risk.

Results
Among 54,452 T2DM patients followed on average 6.6 years, estimated HHF rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.3%, 1.1%, and 2.0%. The final 9‐variable model included: age, coronary artery disease, blood urea nitrogen, atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin A1c, blood albumin, systolic blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and smoking history (c = 0.782). High risk patients identified by the model had a >5% probability of HHF within 5 years.

Conclusions
The proposed model for HHF among T2DM demonstrated strong predictive capacity and may help guide therapeutic decisions.","The current study developed an internally valid prediction model for new HF hospitalization among individuals with pre‐existing or new diagnoses of T2DM who had no prior documented history of HF. Prediction model variables were derived from the EMR of a single, large integrated healthcare system; thus, candidate predictors were necessarily limited to those gathered during usual clinical care. In the final 9‐predictor model, the strongest predictors of HHF in T2DM were (1) age, (2) coronary artery disease, (3) blood urea nitrogen, (4) atrial fibrillation, (5) hemoglobin A1c, (6) blood albumin, (7) systolic blood pressure, (8) chronic kidney disease, and (9) smoking history. The proposed model had a robust c‐statistic of 0.782. A quantitative threshold for labeling T2DM patients as at “high risk” for HHF was proposed as a >5% probability of HHF within 5 years—reflecting the 10% highest risk patients according to prediction model elements. Given the strong association between T2DM and HF, and the contrasting effects of different antidiabetic therapies on HF outcomes, the proposed prediction model may help guide antidiabetic drug selection in circumstances where HF warrants consideration.

Renewed interest in the diabetes‐HF link could be ascribed to the positive results from multiple clinical trials showing reductions in HHF with the sodium glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitor class of diabetic drugs.10, 16 Notably, these beneficial effects were observed among patients both with and without established HF at randomization.10, 16 These findings contrast with previous trials showing adverse or neutral effects of other diabetic drug classes on HF outcomes.9, 14, 19 The importance of considering potential HF‐related effects of antidiabetic therapies is underscored by the high rates of HF risk factors among T2DM patients. Indeed, our study showed that 75% of T2DM patients had CAD, MI, and/or hypertension at the index date.

Though T2DM is strongly associated with a broad range of CV outcomes, and several prediction models exist for predicting CV risk in T2DM, multiple arguments can be put forth for creating a prediction model specifically for HHF.20, 21 First, an HHF is typically associated with an exacerbation of an underlying cardiac disorder, distressing symptoms, and portends an increased risk of short‐term mortality; thus, HHF is a serious health event warranting preventive focus.14, 22 Furthermore, T2DM is frequent among patients with an HHF, with up to 44% of hospital admissions related to HF reporting comorbid diabetes.23 HHF are costly to resolve, and readmissions are frequent, compounding the cost problem. Thus, aligning therapeutic management with future HHF risk allows prioritizing clinical resources toward objectively‐determined high risk patients where the HHF burden (and costs) are expected to be highest.24 Last, the detrimental (beneficial) effects of certain antidiabetic drugs have been most commonly ascribed to worsening (improving) fluid retention and congestion, the primary driver of HHF.4, 25 Accordingly, proper identification of at‐high‐risk‐for‐HHF patients may have implications for selecting appropriate therapy with a potentially significant impact on a frequent, distressing, and costly condition.

The c‐statistic in the current study was larger than typically observed with CV prediction models for T2DM at 0.782, possibly explained by a diabetic cohort both with and without known cardiac conditions at baseline, and consideration of an endpoint more amenable to prediction (HF, rather than MI or ischemic stroke).20, 21 Not surprisingly, multiple CV‐related phenotypes (CAD, atrial fibrillation), traditional CV risk factors (age, systolic blood pressure, smoking), and markers of kidney dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen, albumin) were independent predictors of HHF. Furthermore, the current study was unique in its ability to consider several blood biomarkers commonly measured in usual clinical practice among type 2 diabetics, and blood urea nitrogen, albumin, and hemoglobin A1c were among the final predictors. Notably, hemoglobin A1c was associated with HHF while blood glucose was not; this observation requires further investigation as hemoglobin A1c reflects longer‐term glycemic exposure while blood glucose reflects shorter‐term exposure.26, 27 Hemoglobin A1c has been found to be associated with HF in previous work.28, 29

The practical intent of risk prediction models is to identify high risk patients such that cost‐efficient provision of advanced management strategies (eg, a novel, efficacious, yet expensive pharmaceutical) can be directed toward those patients most likely to experience untoward events, thus minimizing the number needed to treat for benefit.30 Ultimately, a prediction model's quantitative output implicitly proposes an action (or not) by separating “high (enough) risk” (take action) from “not high (enough) risk” (do not take action) patients. The current study is the first to our knowledge to propose such an objective “high risk” threshold for HHF among type 2 diabetics: a >5% probability of HHF within the next five years—reflecting the 10% highest risk patients according to model predictors. Any take action threshold is preferably based on absolute risk estimates, thus stressing the importance of evaluating the calibration of the proposed model in new settings. Understanding that variation in what is judged “high risk” will exist, observed event rates for various risk scores (and percentiles) are provided in Table ​Table3.3. Importantly, the proposed prediction model was developed using data generated from an EMR system which facilitates transporting the proposed model to other healthcare systems with a comparable data source and structure.

Some limitations of this study should be noted. The use of EMR data precludes consideration of certain candidate predictors either not generated during usual clinical care or not routinely available in structured form in our EMR (eg, duration of diabetes). Though the applied operational definitions for study variables were designed to minimize misclassification, measurement error, and missing data, these shortcomings are impossible to resolve completely, and the net effect is likely attenuation of hazard ratios. External validation of the proposed model should precede its application to ensure the model's discrimination and calibration are satisfactory in other settings. External validation is also vital due to the largely white patient population and limited geographical reach of the study institution.

In conclusion, the proposed 9‐predictor model for estimating HHF risk in T2DM showed strong predictive capacity. The proposed high‐risk threshold may serve as an action point for selection of antidiabetic therapeutics—a salient issue considering the opposing effects of different antidiabetic drug classes on HF outcomes."
Predicting Type 2 Diabetes Using Logistic Regression and Machine Learning Approaches,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common human diseases worldwide and may cause several health-related complications. It is responsible for considerable morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. A timely diagnosis and prediction of this disease could provide patients with an opportunity to take the appropriate preventive and treatment strategies. To improve the understanding of risk factors, we predict type 2 diabetes for Pima Indian women utilizing a logistic regression model and decision tree-a machine learning algorithm. Our analysis finds five main predictors of type 2 diabetes: glucose, pregnancy, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, and age. We further explore a classification tree to complement and validate our analysis. The six-fold classification tree indicates glucose, BMI, and age are important factors, while the ten-node tree implies glucose, BMI, pregnancy, diabetes pedigree function, and age as the significant predictors. Our preferred specification yields a prediction accuracy of 78.26% and a cross-validation error rate of 21.74%. We argue that our model can be applied to make a reasonable prediction of type 2 diabetes, and could potentially be used to complement existing preventive measures to curb the incidence of diabetes and reduce associated costs.","Diabetes has become one of the leading causes of human death in recent decades. The incidence of diabetes has been continuously increasing every year due to several reasons including eating habits, sedentary lifestyle, and prevalence of unhealthful foods. Diabetes prediction model can contribute to the decision-making process in clinical management. Knowing the potential risk factors and identifying individuals at high risk in the early stages may aid in diabetes prevention. A host of prediction models for diabetes have been developed and applied, out of which logistic regression [21] and a machine learning algorithm-based classification tree [20] are among the most popular methods. Habibi et al. [6] suggest that a simple machine learning algorithm, a classification tree, could be used to screen diabetes without using a laboratory. However, the validity of these models for different locations, populations with different diets, lifestyle, races, and genetic makeup is still unknown. Additionally, only a limited number of the reliable predictive equation has been suggested for Pima Indian Women. Their prediction performance and validity vary considerably. To fill this gap in the literature, this study used logistic regression and a classification tree from the Pima Indian dataset to identify the important factors for type 2 diabetes. We selected variables based on the goodness of fit test and model selection criteria such as AIC, BIC, and Mallows’ Cp. The decision trees were plotted, and the prediction accuracy and cross-validation error rate were calculated for the purpose of validation. Variables selected from the logistic regression and decision tree are very similar, suggesting that the variable identified helps predict diabetes and may be used as a decision tool.

A higher BMI, reduced insulin secretion and action, a family history of diabetes, blood pressure, smoking status, and pregnancy status are considered common risk factors for type 2 diabetes [33,34]. Our study shows five main predictors for diabetes are frequency of pregnancies in women, glucose, pedigree, BMI, and age. These variables were also used in previous studies to predict diabetes. For example, Bays et al. [35] reported that increased BMI was associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. A study in Finland developed a diabetes risk score to predict diabetes and found that age, parental history of diabetes, BMI, high blood sugar level, and physical activities are among the predictors of diabetes [36]. People with higher glucose are more likely to develop diabetes. It may be because glucose is associated with insulin response [37]. Lyssenko et al. [33] reported that a family history of diabetes could double the risk of the disease. The pedigree provides a synthesis of the diabetes mellitus history in ancestors and the genetic relationship with the subject. It utilizes information from a person’s family history to predict how likely a subject can get diabetes. A higher BMI results in obesity, which could increase the fat content of the pancreas and might affect the function of pancreatic cells. Obesity could also lead to insulin resistance [38,39]. Age is a risk factor for the onset of diabetes. Pancreatic cells lead to the decline of glucose sensitivity and impaired insulin secretion with aging [40]. The validation shows that our model has a relatively good predictive performance. The prediction accuracy of 78% from our preferred specification is close to previous studies on diabetes risk factors. For example, Lyssenko et al. [33] report accuracy rates of 74% to 77% for two different locations in the study of diabetes risk factors. Zou et al. [20] predict diabetes with accuracy values of 77% and 81% for the Pima Indian and Luzhou datasets, respectively. As indicated by Wilson et al. [41], we also found that complex models are not necessary to predict diseases; instead, logistic regression and classification tree techniques can be equally useful in predicting diabetes. However, validation of the proposed model among different groups of the population should be carried out.

We acknowledge the limitations of our analysis. First, only a few predictors were considered to predict the risk of diabetes due to data limitations. Thus, our conclusion may not be generalizable to larger datasets with several predictors. Second, even the best predictive models and variable selection processes may yield different results according to location, type of dataset, and the algorithms used. Finally, we replaced missing values with medians of the respective variables which, although a common practice, could alter results. Future studies could incorporate several other risk factors such as genetic traits, gender, socio-economic status, physical activities, smoking, health information and attitude, food consumption, and spending to predicting diabetes in a more generalized population."
Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediction of diabetes using IDF versus ATPIII criteria in a Middle East population,"This study investigates the prevalence and predictive value of metabolic syndrome in Abu Dhabi, using data from the population-based, programme, ‘Weqaya’. The Weqaya screen included family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk factors, random blood glucose (RBG) and HbA1c. Those not previously diabetic but at high risk of diabetes (RBG ≥ 11.1 mmol/l or HbA1c ≥ 6.1%) and randomly selected normal subjects were followed-up with fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c and fasting triglycerides. In 760 subjects, 325 (42.8%) were male with a mean age of 41.9 years (SD 13.8). Using World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria, 149 (20.2%) were newly diagnosed diabetics. Using International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) criteria, metabolic syndrome was present in 29.0% vs. 31.5% of non-diabetics, 63.4% vs. 64.2% with impaired glucose handling and 78.6% vs. 79.8% with new-onset diabetes using OGTT (P < .001). IDF criteria better predicted pre-diabetes and diabetes (OR 3.4 P < .001; OR 6.4 P < .001, respectively); ATPIII criteria better predicted high CVD risk scores (OR 13.6 P < .001). Whilst IDF and APTIII definitions provide similar prevalence rates, they differentially predict prediabetes, diabetes and CVD. This ongoing study will enable the longitudinal investigation of the development of diabetes and cardiovascular events in this population.",
Understanding type 1 diabetes: etiology and models,"Type 1 diabetes is a complex disease involving a combination of factors, such as genetic susceptibility, immunologic dysregulation and exposure to environmental triggers. Animal models serve an important function both in elucidating the pathophysiology and preliminary screening of antidiabetic molecules. Hence, the development of models for type 1 diabetes can be broadly divided into 3 categories, namely: identification of spontaneously developing type 1 diabetes mellitus strains, creating diabetes-prone species through gene transfer techniques and forced destruction of islet cells through chemical or surgical means. This review discusses the models used to study type 1 diabetes with special emphasis on genetics.","Type 1 diabetes is a complex disease characterized by a combination of factors such as genetic predisposition, dysregulation of the immune system, and exposure to triggering environmental factors.

Study on Risk Factors of Peripheral Neuropathy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Establishment of Prediction Model,"Background
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most serious complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DPN increases the risk of ulcers, foot infections, and noninvasive amputations, ultimately leading to long-term disability.

Methods
Seven hundred patients with T2DM were investigated from 2013 to 2017 in the Sanlin community by obtaining basic data from the electronic medical record system (EMRS). From September 2018 to July 2019, 681 patients (19 missing) were investigated using a questionnaire, physical examination, biochemical index test, and follow-up Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS) test. Patients with a TCSS score ≥6 points were diagnosed with DPN. After removing missing values, 612 patients were divided into groups in a 3:1 ratio for external validation. Using different Lasso analyses (misclassification error, mean squared error, –2log-likelihood, and area under curve) and a logistic regression analysis of the training set, models A, B, C, and D were established. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration plot, dynamic component analysis (DCA) measurements, net classification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to validate discrimination and clinical practicality of the model.

Results
Through data analysis, model A (containing four factors), model B (containing five factors), model C (containing seven factors), and model D (containing seven factors) were built. After calibration, ROC curve, DCA, NRI and IDI, models C and D exhibited better accuracy and greater predictive power.

Conclusion
Four prediction models were established to assist with the early screening of DPN in patients with T2DM. The influencing factors in model C and D are more important factors for patients with T2DM diagnosed with DPN.","Four DPN models were established in this study. According to the results, models C and D were more excellent models. Since the selected variables included in models A and B were all significant in the logistic regression analysis, these factors in model A and model B significantly correlated with DPN. Models C and D were validated by constructing an ROC curve and calibration curve, and were compared with NRI and IDI models, indicating that the accuracy of these two models was significantly better than model A and model B. Therefore, the influencing factors included in model C and model D are the risk factors that patients with T2DM presenting with DPN must closely monitor. According to the four models, seven factors, FBG, PBG, LDL-C, age, TC, BMI, and HbA1c, appear in two or more models and significantly modulate DPN.

Although most of the factors ultimately obtained in this study have a certain coincidence and similarity with the results of previous studies, this study differs from the perspective of statistical research methods and the previous studies using a logistic regression analysis alone. We tried to use the new statistical methods and models to study the risk factors for DPN based on previous studies and explained the problem from different perspectives. Previous researches have used a single factor analysis to validate a multivariate analysis or performed stepwise regression and recycling logistic regression analyses of the process to obtain the results. For example, Pai et al. [6] used a multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the risk factors for DPN in patients with T2DM by investigating the prevalence of and biochemical risk factors for DPN in patients with or without neuropathy. After adjusting for all other potential confounding factors, Khawaja et al. [1] performed a binary logistic regression analysis to determine independent predictors of peripheral neuropathy. However, in this process, various confounding factors must be considered as variables along with the problem of multicollinearity. In the present study, the LASSO regression analysis provided a better solution to this problem with more accurate results. The greatest difference between this method and previous studies using a logistic regression analysis was that the population was randomly divided into groups at a 3:1 ratio for external verification. Variables were screened using the LASSO regression analysis, and a traditional logistic regression analysis was also performed. ROC, calibration and DCA curves were constructed for the training and validation sets to verify the accuracy and stability of the two models. NRI and IDI were introduced to compare the models and assess their stability.

In fact, the present study lacks a review of other factors contributing to DPN in patients with T2DM, including smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, other lifestyle factors, some biochemical parameters, and some pharmacological parameters. For example, a cross-sectional survey showed a strong relationship between a family history of diabetes and the development of DPN [7]. Another survey of 2837 patients showed that insulin therapy, microalbuminuria and apparent albuminuria were independently related to DPN [6]. The leukocyte count is also related to DPN, while oral hypoglycemia will reduce the incidence of DPN [8]. The aforementioned factors, including smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet, were not included in the initial investigation of this study. Therefore, the team was unable to determine whether these factors would cause DPN in patients with T2DM. The research team will conduct a more detailed investigation by collecting samples and analyzing indicators in the population of patients with T2DM in the future and will further analyze the factors influencing peripheral neuropathy in Chinese patients with T2DM by including more people with T2DM and a more comprehensive list of factors.

As shown in the present study, SBP was one of the risk factors for DPN among patients withT2DM, consistent with previous studies. A systematic review showed a 2.6-fold higher SBP in T2DM patients with DPN than in T2DM patients without DPN [9]. Regardless of whether T2DM is accompanied by hypertension, an elevated SBP always increased the risk of DPN [10]. According to the study by Yokoyama et al. [11], the occurrence of diabetic neuropathy is significantly correlated with SBP.

In the data analysis, FBG was one of the important factors influencing the risk of comorbid DPN in T2DM patients. A study of 110 healthy individuals, 83 T2DM patients, and 65 patients with DPN concluded that the FBG was a risk factor for DPN [12]. Higher FBG are associated with a higher probability of developing DPN [8].

The higher LDL-C, the greater the risk of DPN in T2DM patients [13]. The blood viscosity of patients with diabetes increases because of the abnormal blood lipid levels, which impedes blood flow, results in the formation of a micro thrombus, and substantially affecting blood circulation [5]. An insufficient blood supply in the nervous system leads to an energy metabolism disorder, which substantially impairs the transmission of signals in the nervous system [14]. A study of T2DM patients in Taiwan identified elevated LDL-C as an independent risk factor for DPN [15]. The amount of filtrate produced by both kidneys per unit time is called the eGFR, which is an indicator of renal function. This study revealed a close relationship between the eGFR and DPN. Zhang et al. [16] analyzed 1,059 T2DM patients and observed a higher eGFR in the DPN group than in the non-DPN group. The eGFR is an important risk factor for concurrent DPN [16]. DPN is also related to FBG, the diabetes duration and a decreased eGFR [17].

With aging, the resistance of the human body will decrease, the level of organ function will decrease, and the incidence of many diseases will increase. A cross-sectional study identified an older age as a risk factor for DPN [6]. A survey in Myanmar also reported an increased risk of diabetic peripheral disease with aging [18]. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, a survey of 248 patients with diabetes indicated that DPN was independently related to aging [19]. Sendi et al. [7] identified a significant correlation between DPN and increasing age. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study identified age as the most significant risk factor for DPN other than HbA1c levels [20].

A longer disease course increased the probability of T2DM patients diagnosed with DPN. A cross-sectional study showed a positive correlation between disease course and DPN [21]. The duration of diabetes and smoking were significant risk factors for DPN [18]. By performing a logistic regression analysis, Khawaja et al. [1] showed that long-standing diabetes (≥5 years of diabetes) was significantly associated with DPN.

TC is the sum of the cholesterol contained in all lipoproteins in the blood. The analysis performed in this study concluded that TC were associated with DPN. A study of 200 patients with T2DM showed a significant correlation between a TC >5.2 mmol/L and DPN [22].

T2DM patients with DPN are at risk of developing foot ulcers, which substantially affect the quality of life of the patients. The plantar pressure is abnormal in T2DM patients presenting with DPN [23], and the plantar pressure is related to ulcers [24]. In other words, plantar pressure is related to the risk and severity of peripheral neuropathy. Some studies conducted in western countries have shown that obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) causes plantar hypertension [25,26]. Therefore, obese patients with T2DM are more likely to suffer from DPN. In the study by Zhen et al. [27], the prevalence of DPN was 62.62% in obese patients with T2DM and 46.99% in patients with T2DM presenting a normal weight. The prevalence of DPN was significantly different between the two groups [27]. The possible pathogenic mechanism is that the obese patients are too heavy, which increases the pressure on the sole of the foot. This increased pressure causes the direct mechanical destruction of the soft tissue of the foot, ischemia and necrosis due to longterm local tissue compression and repeated forces that induce inflammation [28].

According to the results of the LASSO and logistic regression analyses, PBG are strongly correlated with the risk of DPN in T2DM patients. A related study using a multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for DPN concluded that the 2-hour PBG was positively correlated with DPN [12].

Based on the results of the present study, HbA1c were significantly related to DPN, consistent with other studies. Pai et al. [6] noted significant differences in age, the disease course, and HbA1c between patients with and without DPN. A survey of 37,375 people concluded that T2DM patients and HbA1c greater than 7.0% had an increased risk of DPN. Both T2DM and HbA1c have a linear relationship with DPN [21]. Another group survey also described an association of HbA1c with DPN in patients with diabetes [26]. A study of 388 T2DM patients identified a positive correlation between HbA1c and DPN by performing a multivariate logistic regression analysis [27]. Under normal conditions, the human body can maintain a certain blood sugar level through hormonal and nerve regulation, but under the joint actions of genetic factors and environmental factors (such as an unreasonable diet, obesity, etc.), the regulatory function will be disrupted and the blood sugar level will increase. Short-term and single hyperglycemic event do not cause serious damage to the human body. However, long-term hyperglycemia will cause pathological changes in various tissues and organs of the body, leading to acute and chronic complications, such as decreased resistance, impaired renal function, neuropathy, fundus diseases, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetic foot, among others. Therefore, effective control of HbA1c is helpful to protect against DPN in T2DM patients.

The higher the UA, the higher the risk of cooccurring DPN in T2DM patients, consistent with the results of the study by Papanas et al. [29]. A study by Lin et al. [22] showed a significant correlation between elevated blood UA and DPN, indicating that this parameter is a predictor of DPN. Serum UA were significantly elevated in a meta-analysis of patients with diabetes. Hyperuricemia is significantly associated with an increased risk of DPN, and hyperuricemia is associated with an increased risk of peripheral blood disorders [30]. A positive correlation has been observed between TCSS scores and UA levels [5]. However, further studies are needed to determine whether UA is involved in the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy in patients with T2DM.

This paper has suggested an association between the waist circumference and DPN. A study of diabetes in a young follow-up cohort showed that an increase in waist circumference was significantly associated with DPN [31]. A Danish study also observed associations between a greater weight, waist circumference, and baseline BMI with DPN [32]. An analysis of potential confounding factors for neuropathy by Aubert et al. [33] also showed that the waist circumference was independently associated with peripheral neuropathy. Another Chinese study divided 100 middle-aged subjects into a group of healthy subjects, a group of subjects with T2DM but without DPN within the last 5 years, and a group of subjects with T2DM who were diagnosed with DPN within the last 5 years. DPN was significantly correlated with serum levels of biochemical indicators (TG and HbA1c) and anthropometric indicators (weight and waist circumference) [34]. Oh et al. [35] concluded that subjects with DPN had a higher BMI and greater waist circumference than subjects without DPN, suggesting an association between abdominal obesity and DPN.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a disorder in the synthesis or degradation of heterologous TG. It is an important risk factor for the occurrence of diseases related to metabolic syndrome, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. We concluded that the TG is one of the risk factors for DPN. A higher TG correlates with a greater risk [15]. According to another study, hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for DPN in obese T2DM patients [27]. Three different groups of subjects were analyzed in a study conducted in Taiwan using the percussion impact entropy index (PEIppi). A significant correlation was observed between TG and DPN [34]. A high TG tends to cause “consistence,” namely, a change in the blood viscosity caused by a high lipid content in the blood, deposits on the blood vessel wall, and the gradual formation of small plaques known as atherosclerosis. However, the area and thickness of these massive deposits on the wall of the blood vessel will gradually increase, resulting in a decrease in the internal diameter of the blood vessel, a slower blood flow, and an acceleration of the process of blocking the blood vessel that may even interrupt the blood flow in serious cases. In addition to the interruption of blood flow, the obstruction might also cause a thrombus. If a thrombus occurs in the lower extremities, the blood flow of the extremities is not impaired, leading to necrosis. A 7-year follow-up survey of 8,379 people suggested that reducing cardiovascular risk factors may help prevent DPN. Cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension and high TG, were positively correlated with DPN.

HDL-C correlated with DPN in the present study. Lower HDL-C correlated with a greater risk of DPN in patients with T2DM. In a comparative study by Sun et al. [36], HDL-C in the diabetic group was lower than in the healthy group. In fact, HDL-C exerts an anti-inflammatory effect when present at normal levels. In T2DM patients, a decrease in HDL-C will reduce its anti-inflammatory effect or even promote inflammation [37]. The specific mechanism is that the low HDL-C in T2DM patients activates monocytes and increases the secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). TNF-α is a key factor contributing to the development of atherosclerosis [38]. In other words, HDL-C is transformed into atherogenic granules in patients with T2DM [39] to modulate the cardiovascular function, subsequently causing pathological changes in the nervous system due to the lack of an energy supply.

The study still had some limitations. Regarding the samples, the T2DM patients analyzed were recruited from only one community in Shanghai, which does not represent the conditions of all T2DM patients in Shanghai. T2DM patients who were treated at the hospital or at home were unable to participate in the study. This study also lacked information on other potential risk factors for DPN, including lifestyle factors and drug indicators. The patients who were newly diagnosed with DPN based on the TCSS score may have been false positives. Because DPN is related to other complications of T2DM, the team will incorporate relevant factors associated with these diseases and strive to establish a more perfect DPN prediction model in future studies.

In the present study, models A, B, C, and D were established. Based on the NRI and IDI, model C and D are better predictive models. Thus, the influencing factors included in model C and D are more important risk factors for T2DM patients. FBG, PBG, LDL-C, age, TC, BMI, and HbA1cwere appeared in two or more models and significantly contributed to the risk of DPN"
Exercise training and endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis,"Background and aims
Exercise training is considered a cornerstone in the management of type 2 diabetes, which is associated with impaired endothelial function. However, the association of exercise training with endothelial function in type 2 diabetes patients has not been fully understood. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate their associations with focus on exercise types.

Methods
Databases were searched up to January 2018 for studies evaluating the influences of exercise training with durations ≥ 8 weeks on endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) among type 2 diabetes patients or between type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics. Data were pooled using random-effects models to obtain the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results
Sixteen databases were included. Exercise training resulted in an overall improvement in FMD by 1.77% (95% CI 0.94–2.59%) in type 2 diabetes patients. Specifically, both aerobic and combined aerobic and resistance exercise increased FMD by 1.21% (95% CI 0.23–2.19%) and 2.49% (95% CI 1.17–3.81%), respectively; but resistance exercise only showed a trend. High-intensity interval aerobic exercise did not significantly improve FMD over moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Notably, the improvement in FMD among type 2 diabetes patients was smaller compared with non-diabetics in response to exercise training (WMD − 0.72%, 95% CI − 1.36 to − 0.08%) or specifically to aerobic exercise (WMD − 0.65%, 95% CI − 1.31 to 0.01%).

Conclusions
Exercise training, in particular aerobic and combined exercise, improves endothelial function in type 2 diabetes patients, but such an improvement appears to be weakened compared with non-diabetics.

Our meta-analysis revealed that exercise training, in particular aerobic and combined aerobic and resistance exercise, significantly improved endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes, as indicated by increased FMD; and this manner seemed to be independent of changes in traditional cardiometabolic markers including BMI, blood pressure, glycemic control, or cardiorespiratory fitness in relation to exercise training. However, our meta-analysis did not provide adequate evidence that high-intensity interval aerobic exercise was superior to moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise in improving endothelial function. Noteworthy, the increases in FMD in response to exercise training in type 2 diabetics were lower than that in non-diabetics, indicating that the presence of diabetes may weaken the exercise training effects on endothelial function.

Interpretations
Our study showed that exercise training, a non-pharmacological therapy, led to an overall improvement in FMD by 1.77%. This is of clinical importance for patients with type 2 diabetes, since on the one hand, every 1% increase in FMD was correlated with an estimated 13% risk reduction of cardiovascular events based on the report from van Sloten and colleagues [35]; and on the other hand, such an increase in FMD is even larger than or comparable to those from pharmacological interventions like statin therapy [36] or phosphodiesterase inhibitors use [37], which result in an improvement in FMD by 0.94% (95% CI 0.38–1.5%) and 2.19% (95% CI 0.48–3.90%), respectively. Although not fully understood, it is speculated that the observed beneficial effects of exercise training on endothelial function might be underlined by the following mechanisms. Firstly, exercise training causes an increase in blood flow, which augments shear stresses on the endothelium, leading to increased nitric oxide synthesis and bioavailability [1]. Secondly, exercise training reduces oxidative stress and the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules [38], both of which are considered initiating factors for endothelial dysfunction. Thirdly, exercise training may help to restore the function of endothelial progenitor cells, promoting endothelial repair and facilitating vascular angiogenesis subsequently [39].

Partly in agreement with our finding, the prior meta-analysis by Montero and colleagues as well as the review paper by Miele and colleagues had also observed the beneficial effects of exercise training on endothelial function assessed by FMD in patients with type 2 diabetes [13, 26]. However, our study, which included more RCTs and introduced subgroup and meta-regression analyses, extended their findings by providing in-depth analyses of the training effects from the specific exercise type on FMD and exploring the potential moderators. In our study despite a non-significant increase in FMD after resistance exercise, both aerobic and combined exercise were effective in improving FMD, which corresponds well with the results from the meta-analysis conducted in a heterogeneous adult population [40]. Yet inconsistent with our finding, Way and colleagues argued that aerobic exercise may not be able to improve FMD in patients with type 2 diabetes [41], which might be due to their limited number of studies included.

In addition, the largest increase in FMD observed in combined exercise suggests that this mixed form might be superior to aerobic or resistance exercise in improving endothelial function based on our subgroup analyses across exercise types with indirect comparisons. However, it is noteworthy that they may not control for energy expenditure or training duration in every section, and that there was only a single study with a small sample size that explored the influence of resistance exercise on endothelial function [17], which might affect the outcomes of interest (e.g., may underestimate the effects of resistance exercise). Future studies are in need to determine which exercise type might be the best one in increasing FMD using head-to-head designs with the energy expenditure- and/or training time-matched for each section across different exercise types.

In recent years Ramos and colleagues reported that high-intensity interval aerobic exercise, which acts in a time-saving manner [42, 43], produces a greater positive influence on endothelial function versus moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise in a mixed adult population [44]. However, our meta-analysis in patients with type 2 diabetes did not provide adequate evidence in support of this notion, which might be largely attributable to the differences in the target populations as well as the small number of studies included. Moreover, Ramos and colleagues pointed out that the improvement in endothelial function associated with high-intensity interval aerobic exercise over moderate-intensity continuous exercise might be owing to its superiority in increasing cardiorespiratory fitness, improving glycemic control, and lowering blood pressure, suggesting a potential positive linkage between endothelial function and cardiometabolic markers [44]. Yet our meta-regression analyses, based on the averages of participant characteristics for each study did not support such an assumption, which could be also evidenced by the findings from the individual study by Gibbs and colleagues [20] and the cross-sectional observation [45]. It seems likely that the benefits of exercise training on endothelial function are independent of improvements in cardiometabolic health among patients with type 2 diabetes, which, albeit, still requires further investigations using the individual participant data.

In addition to suggesting a positive influence of exercise training on endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes, our study showed that the improvement in endothelial function in response to chronic exercise training was weakened in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with those without. Although the exact mechanism is not well understood, it is speculated that the presence of diabetes may compromise the ability of the endothelium to endogenously increase vascular nitric oxide bioavailability following exercise training [31], possibly because of the persistent hyperglycemia and the increased levels of circulating advanced glycation end products or reactive oxygen species [46, 47]. Moreover, the blunted potential of exercise to stimulate and to mobilize endothelial progenitor cells observed in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic controls might also contribute to the weakened improvement in endothelial function in response to exercise among type 2 diabetes [46]. These may indicate that more interventions apart from promoting physical exercise might be needed for patients with type 2 diabetes to obtain comparable health benefits like healthy or non-diabetic controls.

Limitations
Despite a comprehensive exploration of the exercise training effects on endothelial function among patients with type 2 diabetes, this meta-analysis has some limitations. Firstly, some studies reported changes in medication use in the intervention period or used co-interventions like dietary programs [48], which may influence the endothelial function and contributed to heterogeneity. However, our sensitivity analyses indicated that they are unlikely to have important impacts on the main findings. Secondly, most of the included studies implemented exercise interventions within 12 weeks, which largely represents a relatively short-term effect on endothelial function, although our meta-regression analysis suggested that intervention periods were not likely to affect the changes in endothelial function associated with exercise training. More studies are therefore warranted to explore the long-term (e.g., over 6 months) effects of exercise training on endothelial function, just as suggested by Lenasi and colleagues [46]. Thirdly, some variances existed in the measurement methods for FMD. However, these methods were well defined in general. Although it is reported that the measurement of peak dilation at 60 s after cuff release may result in an underestimation of true FMD by up to 40% [49], this factor seems to have had a minor influence on our outcomes on FMD since all studies except the one by Hollekim-Strand and colleagues [24] had already adopted a continuous measurement of post-deflation diameter within the time-window as aforementioned. Finally, our study did not search for unpublished studies and had a language restriction, which may cause some selection bias.

Modelling diabetic nephropathy in mice,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the developed world. Accordingly, an urgent need exists for new, curative treatments as well as for biomarkers to stratify risk of DN among individuals with diabetes mellitus. A barrier to progress in these areas has been a lack of animal models that faithfully replicate the main features of human DN. Such models could be used to define the pathogenesis, identify drug targets and test new therapies. Owing to their tractability for genetic manipulation, mice are widely used to model human diseases, including DN. Questions have been raised, however, about the general utility of mouse models in human drug discovery. Standard mouse models of diabetes typically manifest only modest kidney abnormalities, whereas accelerated models, induced by superimposing genetic stressors, recapitulate key features of human DN. Incorporation of systems biology approaches and emerging data from genomics and metabolomics studies should enable further model refinement. Here, we discuss the current status of mouse models for DN, their limitations and opportunities for improvement. We emphasize that future efforts should focus on generating robust models that reproduce the major clinical and molecular phenotypes of human DN.","Animal models that faithfully recapitulate the clinical features of diabetic nephropathy (DN) are needed to help to define the pathogenesis, identify new drug targets, and test novel therapies

Substantial efforts have focused on developing models of DN in mice owing to their tractability for genetic manipulation and other advantages such as fecundity and low cost

The extent of kidney pathology in standard mouse models of diabetes is typically quite modest, resembling only the early stage of diabetic microalbuminuria in humans

Superimposing genetic stressors on standard diabetes platforms has resulted in more robust mouse models of DN that manifest high-grade albuminuria, nodular glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension

No current models of DN develop progressive loss of renal function leading to end-stage renal disease

Incorporating data from genomics and metabolomics studies into modelling efforts should enable the generation of mouse models that more closely mimic human DN and thus enhance translational research in the field

Putting the pieces together in diabetes research: towards a hierarchical model of whole-body glucose homeostasis,"Type 2 diabetes is one of the most widespread and rapidly spreading diseases world-wide and has been subject of extensive research efforts. However, understanding the molecular basis of the disease is increasing piecemeal and a consensus regarding the overall picture of normal metabolic regulation and malfunction in diabetes has not emerged. A systems biology approach, combining mathematical modelling with simultaneous high-throughput measurements, can be of considerable help. On the whole-body level, this has been done in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models, which recently have started to mature into more physiologically realistic organ-based models. At the other end of the spectrum, detailed models for crucial cellular processes are starting to mature into complete modules that potentially can be fitted into such whole-body organ-based models. The result of such a merge is a multi-level hierarchical model, which is a model type that has been common in technical systems. In this review, we report and exemplify some of the recent progress that has been made to achieve such a hierarchical model, and we argue why it is only through such a model that a complete picture of diabetes mellitus can be obtained.","The emphasis of this review article is the development of a hierarchical model for glucose homeostasis. So far we have been concerned with the nature of such a model, which the steps towards constructing such a model would be, and which of these steps that already have been taken. Now we will end by taking a critical look at the pros and cons of undertaking such a work. Is it really a realistic goal to achieve such a model? What are the main obstacles? And, if realistic, is it really worth the"
Animal models for diabetes insipidus,"The hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a nonapeptide synthesized by hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei and secreted from the posterior pituitary into the bloodstream. It binds to AVP receptor 2 in the kidney to promote the insertion of aquaporin channels (AQP2) and antidiuretic responses. AVP secretion deficits produce central diabetes insipidus (CDI), while renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of AVP causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Hereditary and acquired forms of CDI and NDI generate hypotonic polyuria, polydipsia, hyperosmolality, and hypernatremia. The AVP mutant (Brattleboro) rat is the principal animal model of hereditary CDI, while neurohypophysectomy, pituitary stalk compression, hypophysectomy, and mediobasal hypothalamic lesions produce acquired CDI. In animals, hereditary NDI is mainly caused by mutations in AVP2R or AQP2 genes, while acquired NDI is most frequently induced by lithium. We report here on the determinants of the intake and excretion of water and mineral salts and on the different types of DI in humans. We then describe the hydromineral characteristics of these animal models and the responses observed after administration of hypertonic NaCl or when they are fed with low-sodium diets. Finally, we report on the effects of drugs such as AVP analogues and/or oxytocin, another neuropeptide that increases sodium excretion in animal models and humans with CDI, and sildenafil, a compound that increases the expression and function of AQP2 channels in animal models and humans with NDI.",
The oxidative aging model integrated various risk factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus at system level,"Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic endocrine metabolic disease caused by insulin dysregulation. Studies have shown that aging-related oxidative stress (as ""oxidative aging"") play a critical role in the onset and progression of T2DM, by leading to an energy metabolism imbalance. However, the precise mechanisms through which oxidative aging lead to T2DM are yet to be fully comprehended. Thus, it is urgent to integrate the underlying mechanisms between oxidative aging and T2DM, where meaningful prediction models based on relative profiles are needed.

Methods: First, machine learning was used to build the aging model and disease model. Next, an integrated oxidative aging model was employed to identify crucial oxidative aging risk factors. Finally, a series of bioinformatic analyses (including network, enrichment, sensitivity, and pan-cancer analyses) were used to explore potential mechanisms underlying oxidative aging and T2DM.

Results: The study revealed a close relationship between oxidative aging and T2DM. Our results indicate that nutritional metabolism, inflammation response, mitochondrial function, and protein homeostasis are key factors involved in the interplay between oxidative aging and T2DM, even indicating key indices across different cancer types. Therefore, various risk factors in T2DM were integrated, and the theories of oxi-inflamm-aging and cellular senescence were also confirmed.

Conclusion: In sum, our study successfully integrated the underlying mechanisms linking oxidative aging and T2DM through a series of computational methodologies.","It is well known that aging-related oxidative stress plays a crucial role in T2DM (3). However, the essential relationship among aging, oxidative stress and T2DM still needs to be explored in more depth. In this paper, a series of computational methods were performed to explore these relationships in T2DM as well as the relative mechanisms. First, both the aging model and disease model were optimized, and relative aging markers and disease markers were identified. Next, the integrated oxidative aging model was built to identify essential “aging-oxidative-disease” relationships. Finally, network analysis, enrichment analysis, sensitivity analysis and pan-cancer analysis were used to further explore the potential mechanisms between oxidative aging and T2DM. As a result, various risk factors in T2DM were integrated.

Our results highlighted that energy metabolism was vital to the development of T2DM. For example, the integrated oxidative aging model identified a series of key markers in T2DM that were closely related to energy metabolism. OSBPL1A and T1GD4 participate in nutritional metabolism; the former is mainly involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol metabolism, and the latter is mainly related to glycogen metabolism (32–34). ADPRH and PPP1R15A can lead to energy metabolism imbalance (35, 63). COX5A can affect mitochondrial function, and ATOX1 is the redox catalyst, both of which can affect energy metabolism through mitochondrial dysfunction (39, 65). Furthermore, as the top network marker, SCD is mainly expressed in adipose tissue and can catalyze the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (116). It can affect lipid metabolism and mediate steroidogenesis, which plays an important role in insulin resistance (117, 118). SIRT1 was also identified by calculating the betweenness. In MCMC, the greatest difference in the absolute value pair was “OSBPL7-COX7C-TM6SF1”, where OSBPL7 participates in lipid binding and transport (49, 50) and COX7C is related to cellular respiration as a potential biomarker of diabetes (51, 52). The classical energy metabolism pathway, “mTOR signaling pathway”, was also identified using the enrichment analysis, indicating the key interaction between oxidative aging and T2DM.

Protein homeostasis is also involved in the progression of T2DM. For instance, amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an oxidative marker identified by MCMC that promotes the secretion of amyloid proteins (164). SPI1 (Spi-1 Proto-Oncogene) was involved in the negative regulation of protein, which caused restraint of aerobic glycolysis (165) (Figure 3). In summary, both APP and SPI1 are related to protein homeostasis and even accelerate the development of both T2DM and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). That is, protein homeostasis is a common mechanism in both T2DM and ND (166, 167).

The inflammatory response also plays an important role in the development of T2DM. For example, the aging marker HPS1 affects the biogenesis of lysosome-associated cellular organelles and even participates in regulating cellular inflammation (61, 62). The disease marker TPST1 induces the secretion of some cytokines, along with the inflammatory response (37, 38). TM6SF1, as one of the key markers identified by MCMC, was involved in transmembrane transport in macrophages, thus highlighting the key role of the immune system in T2DM (53).

Furthermore, there are a series of experiments and relative clinical stastic results also revealed significant relationships between the identified oxidative aging markers and T2DM. For example, it has been reported that in vitro oxidative stress in mammalian skeletal muscle leads to substantial insulin resistance to distal insulin signaling and glucose transport activity (p=9.2e-05) (168). Chronic oxidative stress can also leads to decreased responsiveness to insulin, ultimately leading to diabetes reported by Alina Berdichevsky et al (p=0.01) (169). Besides, NFKBIA affects the wound healing in diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) (p=0.006) (170), MYC and SCD are related to pyroptosis and immune infiltration in T2DM (p=0.001) (171). The experiment of Parker C. Wilson et al using single-nucleus RNA sequencing has been revealed that GCH1 is associated with early-stage diabetic nephropathy (p=4.88e-09) (172) In short, our results also presented key clinical indices with the help of the integrated oxidative model.

T2DM is associated with an increased risk of developing cancers, such as COAD, PRAD, and THCA (30). It is well known that T2DM and cancer have common risk factors, such as oxidative stress, energy metabolism, inflammation and protein homeostasis (22, 23, 173). Our results also proved that inflammation and energy metabolism were common risk factors in cancers, and even survival analysis further verified the key role of oxidative aging markers across different cancer types. Oxidative stress may lead to chronic inflammation, which in turn can induce most chronic diseases, including both cancer and T2DM. In addition, oxidative stress can damage the normal function of mitochondria as well as energy metabolism, which plays an important role in the development of T2DM and cancer. In short, various risk factors related to oxidative aging were also confirmed in cancer.

According to the oxi-inflamm-aging theory, the aging process is regulated by chronic oxidative stress, as well as the inflammatory response (174). It is well known that dysregulated oxidative stress triggers a series of signaling pathways, thus leading to pancreatic beta cell damage (175). In addition, the cellular senescence theory also highlights cellular inflammation and the oxidative stress response during the aging process (176, 177). That is, cellular senescence may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM (i.e., through the mTOR signaling pathway) (177, 178). Furthermore, these risk factors even interact with each other and then promote T2DM. For example, the imbalance of energy metabolism could interact with a series of pathways, such as lipid accumulation, chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, triggering T2DM progression (179). It has been reported that normal homeostasis in the insulin-driven immunometabolic network is vital to the preservation of insulin sensitivity in healthy aging (180). Here, our work also highlighted the interaction between the immune system and energy metabolism in the development of T2DM (Figure 3; Tables 5, 6), which is also crucial in cancer (Figures 4, 5). With the help of the integrated oxidative aging model, our study revealed that oxidative stress was interrelated with various aging-related risk factors in T2DM (Tables 2–6), such as the inflammatory response, mitochondrial function and protein homeostasis. These results further confirmed both the oxi-inflamm-aging and cellular senescence theories. Overall, potential aging-related mechanisms in T2DM were integrated in the context of oxidative stress (Figure 6).

Animal models in diabetes and pregnancy,"The worldwide increase in the incidence of diabetes, the increase in type 2 diabetes in women at reproductive ages, and the cross-generation of the intrauterine programming of type 2 diabetes are the bases for the growing interest in the use of experimental diabetic models in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of induction of developmental alterations in maternal diabetes. In this scenario, experimental models that present the most common features of diabetes in pregnancy are highly required. Several important aspects of human diabetic pregnancies such as the increased rates of spontaneous abortions, malformations, fetoplacental impairments, and offspring diseases in later life can be approached by using the appropriate animal models. The purpose of this review is to give a practical and critical guide into the most frequently used experimental models in diabetes and pregnancy, discuss their advantages and limitations, and describe the aspects of diabetes and pregnancy for which these models are thought to be adequate. This review provides a comprehensive view and an extensive analysis of the different models and phenotypes addressed in diabetic animals throughout pregnancy. The review includes an analysis of the surgical, chemical-induced, and genetic experimental models of diabetes and an evaluation of their use to analyze early pregnancy defects, induction of congenital malformations, placental and fetal alterations, and the intrauterine programming of metabolic diseases in the offspring's later life.
","Several important aspects of human diabetic pregnancies such as the increases in the rates of early embryo loss, spontaneous abortions, malformations, fetoplacental impairments and offspring’s diseases in later life can be studied using the appropriate animal models. The scheme in Fig. 1 illustrates the broad putative uses of experimental models of diabetes and pregnancy, indicating that there are multiple experimental possibilities to approach the evaluation of the numerous possible phenotypes that comprise the human development in maternal diabetes.
In maternal diabetes, both the maternal environment and the genetic background are important in the complex and multifactorial processes that induce damage to the embryo, the placenta, the fetus, and the offspring. Thus, the use of experimental models of diabetes is crucial in the determination of these damaging pathways. Although there is no doubt that several diabetic models present similar patterns of the most characteristic features of human diabetic pregnancies, the mechanisms involved in these alterations and those mechanisms developed to prevent these anomalies require corroboration because the same mechanisms do not always explain the diabetic phenotype in diabetic patients and animals. However, there are obvious limitations in the study of diabetic pregnant women together with an important need of new strategies to improve and help in the difficult issue of managing these patients to prevent developmental impairments. Therefore, animal studies are critical for understanding the pathophysiology of diabetes-induced defects throughout pregnancy, and the use of experimental models of diabetes is justified and highly encouraged as a first stage for the evaluation of possible approaches to prevent diabetes-induced developmental defects."
Modelling the economics of type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention: a literature review of methods,"Our objective was to review modelling methods for type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention cost-effectiveness studies. The review was conducted to inform the design of a policy analysis model capable of assisting resource allocation decisions across a spectrum of prevention strategies. We identified recent systematic reviews of economic evaluations in diabetes prevention and management of obesity. We extracted studies from two existing systematic reviews of economic evaluations for the prevention of diabetes. We extracted studies evaluating interventions in a non-diabetic population with type 2 diabetes as a modelled outcome, from two systematic reviews of obesity intervention economic evaluations. Databases were searched for studies published between 2008 and 2013. For each study, we reviewed details of the model type, structure, and methods for predicting diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our review identified 46 articles and found variation in modelling approaches for cost-effectiveness evaluations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Investigation of the variables used to estimate the risk of type 2 diabetes suggested that impaired glucose regulation, and body mass index were used as the primary risk factors for type 2 diabetes. A minority of cost-effectiveness models for diabetes prevention accounted for the multivariate impacts of interventions on risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Twenty-eight cost-effectiveness models included cardiovascular events in addition to type 2 diabetes. Few cost-effectiveness models have flexibility to evaluate different intervention types. We conclude that to compare a range of prevention interventions it is necessary to incorporate multiple risk factors for diabetes, diabetes-related complications and obesity-related co-morbidity outcomes.","In answer to objective 5, we did not identify an economic model whose design and structure was completely suitable for comparing the cost effectiveness of diabetes prevention interventions within the general population, for individuals with hyperglycaemia, and for individuals who demonstrate metabolic risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The majority of the models identified in this review could estimate the incidence of diabetes for a set of individuals or cohort according to the metabolic risk profile (i.e. BMI) or a blood test for glycaemia (FPG, OGTT or HbA1c), but not both. This structural limitation for the current decision problem can be resolved with a multivariate risk equation for diabetes. We identified two multivariate risk scores for diabetes. Stern [61] included several metabolic risk factors that was useful because both BMI and glycaemic status were included. However, one of the limitations of this risk equation was that it did not include many of the non-clinical risk factors for diabetes that can be used to identify individuals for a screening programme. In contrast, the QDiabetes score used in Gillett included BMI, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking and a family history of diabetes [12, 37]. However, this risk equation did not include data on FPG or HbA1c test results. Consequently, we propose that further statistical analysis is required to pool together the strengths of both approaches. Including other risk factors will increase the complexity of the model, but will account for within-individual correlations between the risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A multivariate risk model for diabetes diagnosis would describe the independent effects of multiple risk factors for diabetes, thus allowing a range of policies impacting upon different risk factors to be assessed.

There are some methodological advantages and also limitations in relation to the review. The search process adopted broad inclusion criteria for intervention type and target population to capture interventions in a range of at-risk populations. Rather than conducting a large new systematic review, we updated recent, good-quality, systematic reviews of diabetes and obesity prevention interventions. We have updated the reviews to identify recently published articles and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria of previous reviews, given our objective to identify models that include diabetes diagnosis as an outcome. The review excluded evaluations of interventions in children because the time horizon and diabetes progression in children is markedly different to an adult population. We identified two reviews of interventions in IGR [6, 8] and two in obesity [7, 11]. As a consequence we have identified a broad distinction between models that describe risk through IGR or BMI. A previous systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies of obesity compared modelling methods and identified methodological deficiencies in the models [11].

It is clear that to change population-wide behaviour patterns, prevention is needed across a spectrum of population-wide and targeted interventions [73]. What is less clear is how to allocate resources across this spectrum. To answer this question, models are required that are flexible to consider multiple populations and intervention types. This review of economic studies provided an important step in the design and development of a future policy analysis model. However, further research is needed to develop an economic model of a broad range of diabetes prevention interventions, including literature searches for data on the epidemiology of diabetes prevention and its co-morbidities, input from stakeholders to develop our understanding of the decision problem and a clinically appropriate model structure, the development of a description of current resource pathways, and new statistical analyses to develop a bespoke tool for predicting diabetes, conditional on multiple risk factors."
Comparative performance of diabetes-specific and general population-based cardiovascular risk assessment models in people with diabetes mellitus,"Aim: Multivariable models for estimating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with diabetes comprise general population-based models and those from diabetic cohorts. Whether one set of models should receive preference is unclear. We evaluated the evidence on direct comparisons of the performance of general population vs diabetes-specific CVD risk models in people with diabetes.

Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to March 2013. Two reviewers independently identified studies that compared the performance of general CVD models vs diabetes-specific ones in the same group of people with diabetes. Independent, dual data extraction on study design, risk models, outcomes; and measures of performance was conducted.

Results: Eleven articles reporting on 22 pair wise comparisons of a diabetes-specific model (UKPDS, ADVANCE and DCS risk models) to a general population model (three variants of the Framingham model, Prospective Cardiovascular Münster [PROCAM] score, CardioRisk Manager [CRM], Joint British Societies Coronary Risk Chart [JBSRC], Progetto Cuore algorithm and the CHD-Riskard algorithm) were eligible. Absolute differences in C-statistic of diabetes-specific vs general population-based models varied from -0.13 to 0.09. Comparisons for other performance measures were unusual. Outcomes definitions were congruent with those applied during model development. In 14 comparisons, the UKPDS, ADVANCE or DCS diabetes-specific models were superior to the general population CVD risk models. Authors reported better C-statistic for models they developed.

Conclusion: The limited existing evidence suggests a possible discriminatory advantage of diabetes-specific over general population-based models for CVD risk stratification in diabetes. More robust head-to-head comparisons are needed to confirm this trend and strengthen recommendations.","Our study is the first exhaustive overview of the comparative accuracy of diabetes-specific and non-specific CVD risk models in people with diabetes. Available studies suggest that for CVD risk estimation in people with diabetes, diabetes-specific models are at least equivalent to and possibly better than models from the general population. However, studies were limited in number, and their findings somewhat inconsistent, which may affect their generalisability. Differences in models

Diabesity: the combined burden of obesity and diabetes on heart disease and the role of imaging,"Diabesity is a term used to describe the combined adverse health effects of obesity and diabetes mellitus. The worldwide dual epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is an important public health issue. Projections estimate a sixfold increase in the number of adults with obesity in 40 years and an increase in the number of individuals with diabetes to 642 million by 2040. Increased adiposity is the strongest risk factor for developing diabetes. Early detection of the effects of diabesity on the cardiovascular system would enable the optimal implementation of effective therapies that prevent atherosclerosis progression, cardiac remodelling, and the resulting ischaemic heart disease and heart failure. Beyond conventional imaging techniques, such as echocardiography, CT and cardiac magnetic resonance, novel post-processing tools and techniques provide information on the biological processes that underlie metabolic heart disease. In this Review, we summarize the effects of obesity and diabetes on myocardial structure and function and illustrate the use of state-of-the-art multimodality cardiac imaging to elucidate the pathophysiology of myocardial dysfunction, prognosticate long-term clinical outcomes and potentially guide treatment strategies.","Diabesity describes the combined detrimental health effects of obesity and diabetes mellitus.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: a comprehensive overview,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability to concentrate urine that results in polyuria and polydipsia, despite having normal or elevated plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP). In this study, we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various etiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments. NDI has different clinical manifestations and approaches according to the etiology. Hereditary forms of NDI are mainly caused by mutations in the genes that encode key proteins in the AVP signaling pathway, while acquired causes are normally associated with specific drug exposure, especially lithium, and hydroelectrolytic disorders. Clinical manifestations of the disease vary according to the degree of dehydration and hyperosmolality, being worse when renal water losses cannot be properly compensated by fluid intake. Regarding the diagnosis of NDI, it is important to consider the symptoms of the patient and the diagnostic tests, including the water deprivation test and the baseline plasma copeptin measurement, a stable surrogate biomarker of AVP release. Without proper treatment, patients may developcomplications leading to high morbidity and mortality, such as severe dehydration and hypernatremia. In that sense, the treatment of NDI consists in decreasing the urine output, while allowing appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia, and ensuring an acceptable quality of life. Therefore, therapeutic options include nonpharmacological interventions, including sufficient water intake and a low-sodium diet, and pharmacological treatment. The main medications used for NDI are thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and amiloride, used isolated or in combination.",
Neuropathy in experimental diabetes: an animal model,"A morphometric study of the common peroneal nerve in early experimental diabetes in rats showed that fibre size was diminished. The reduction in the size of the axon was twice that of the myelin sheath.

A rat model for pituitary stalk electric lesion-induced central diabetes insipidus: application of 3D printing and further outcome assessments,"A stable and reproducible rat injury model is not currently available to study central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and the neurohypophyseal system. In addition, a system is needed to assess the severity of CDI and measure the accompanying neurobiological alterations. In the present study, a 3D-printed lesion knife with a curved head was designed to fit into the stereotaxic instrument. The neuro-anatomical features of the brain injury were determined by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) immunostaining on brain sections. Rats that underwent pituitary stalk electrical lesion (PEL) exhibited a tri-phasic pattern of CDI. MRI revealed that the hyperintenseT1-weighted signal of the pituitary stalk was interrupted, and the brain sections showed an enlarged end proximal to the injury site after PEL. In addition, the number of AVP-positive cells in supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) decreased after PEL, which confirmed the success of the CDI model. Unlike hand-made tools, the 3D-printed lesion knives were stable and reproducible. Next, we used an ordinal clustering method for staging and the k-means' clustering method to construct a CDI index to evaluate the severity and recovery of CDI that could be used in other multiple animals, even in clinical research. In conclusion, we established a standard PEL model with a 3D-printed knife tool and proposed a CDI index that will greatly facilitate further research on CDI.","We designed a 3D-printed metal knife that was compatible with the stereotaxic instrument to create a standard and reproducible PEL long-term model, which induced a tri-phasic CDI in rats. In addition, we also classified the post-PEL CDI during the 4-week experimental period into four phases based on certain biological parameters. Based on these data, we have proposed a CDI index to evaluate the severity and the subsequent recovery. Finally, we performed in vivo MRI scans to identify the lesion sites and AVP immunostaining to track axon regeneration and the atrophy of the magnocellular nucleus, with results that were consistent with previous studies.

Neuro-lobectomy is one of the best methods to study neurohypophyseal function since the surgical removal of the neural (and intermediate) lobe can be accomplished with minimal damage to either the anterior lobe or even the rest of the brain. CDI induced by the transection of the pituitary stalk in rats was first introduced by Makara [19, 20] and Dohanics [8]. Makara constructed four specially shaped knives and used elaborate skills to turn the angle for the denervation of the posterior pituitary (the neural lobe and the intermediate lobe) in a dorsal approach. Another lesion tool made by Dohanics was a triangular-shaped wire that could be fastened to the electrode carrier of the stereotaxic apparatus, by which the pituitary stalk was compressed directly to generate an animal model for CDI. In addition, other researchers have used the advanced method to create the CDI model [11, 17, 18]. However, the caveats included the simplicity and reproducibility of lesion tools to obtain a stable model. Therefore, we designed a lesion knife in a 3D format and printed it using a metallic material. The curved head of the knife was designed to fit with the sella of the rat skull base (120–300 g). The width was a little shorter than the distance between the medial walls of the bilateral V nerve. The optimal thickness of the knife was achieved with the help of the latest 3-D printer specifications. This tool was therefore equipped to apply both the electric lesions as well as the compression during the surgical procedure.

The pattern of biological parameters in rats with CDI differs depending on the triggering method used [5, 6, 8, 11, 25]. In this study, we used DWC, DUV and daily USG as the evaluation parameters since they are easy to observe and record. The course of postoperative CDI can be transient, permanent or tri-phasic in patients with pituitary damage. The tri-phasic pattern occurs in 3.4% of patients who undergo trans-sphenoid surgery, and only the first 2 phases occur in 1.1% of those patients with pituitary damage [14]. In this study, we classified four distinct CDI stages during a four-week post-operative period with the help of the ordinal clustering method. In phase I, i.e., the day after the surgery, DWC and DUV increased dramatically while USG was significantly lower than 1.010. Phase II was seen between 2–3 days post-surgery with low levels of DWC and DUV and high USG. Phase III, ranging from days 4–19 post surgery, was also characterized by polydipsia and polyuria, which peaked on day 8. Finally, the biological parameters returned to normal after 20 days, and the animals entered Phase IV.

We have posed a hypothesis to explain the mechanism behind this multi-phasic CDI. The polydipsia and polyuria seen in phase I could be a result of a temporary dysfunction of AVP-secreting neurons, either due to disrupted connections between the body of the magnocellular neurons and the nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary or due to the destruction of the vascular supply in the nerve perturbations. This finding is likely followed by an uncontrolled release of AVP or OXT from either the degenerating posterior pituitary tissue or from the remaining magnocellular neurons, resulting in the changes seen in phase II [10]. Other possible reasons for phase II could be an up-regulation of dendritic secretion or increased neurohypophyseal hormone secretion into the peripheral circulation through the cerebrospinal fluid [15]. The third phase of CDI follows the depletion of AVP that results from the degeneration of hypothalamic AVP and OXT-secreting neuronal cell bodies. With the passage of time, magnocellular cells in the SON and PVN were gradually lost due to apoptosis, leading to insufficient AVP and OXT to maintain the normal level of urination and balance of electrolytes and fluids, a feature that is permanent in some patients [10]. However, in our study, the animals exhibited a recovery phase, or phase IV, which is likely due to neuronal and axonal regeneration in the ectopic neural lobe and to angiogenesis [26,27,28,29,30].

Although the time course for the biological parameters of CDI during the post-operative period was easy to depict, it was still difficult to measure the CDI severity and recovery in rats. We have therefore proposed a CDI index, which is defined as the ratio of the number of data points in the abnormal cluster to the total data points. Based on the four-phase division of CDI as described above, we defined the CDI index during the first 14 days post-surgery as severe (a14d), when a longer duration i.e., more days of CDI symptoms corresponded to a worse situation and a higher grade of CDI index. Similarly, the CDI index of the last 7 days (p21d) was represented as the recovery phase in this study. The advantage of this CDI index assessment system was that multiple parameters could be incorporated.

In addition to the measurement of biological parameters, we also performed imaging studies to locate the precise sites of the lesions and confirm the accuracy of the surgical operation without sacrificing the animals and staining brain sections. MRI could capture enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted sagittal images in the control rats. The pituitary stalk lies over the sella and is linked to the pituitary to form a PPit, which emitted high signal in contrast enhanced T1-weighted images. The reason for such high signals was that the MRI reagents could easily penetrate the tissues on account of a lack of any blood-brain barrier (BBB) as well as the unmyelinated nature of the magnocellular nerve projections in the pituitary stalk [24]. The PEL procedure completely disrupted the continuous high signal of pituitary stalk, indicating surgical success.

The number of AVP-positive cells can be regarded as an alternative assessment of injury since the mid-sagittal plane displays the lesion site clearly following AVP or OXT staining [8]. In our study, few AVP-ir cells were seen in the PPit after PEL surgery. In addition, not only was the number of magnocellular cells decreased, but the length and number of dendrites of those cells also degenerated over time.

With serum AVP detected and biological characteristics analysis, we found that rats with PEL can recover from CDI after a long time, despite there is few AVP-ir cells in the SON and PVN we observed, we assume that, there are still some gliocytes in SON and PVN which might enhance the ability of the remained AVP neurons as compensation after PEL. Secondly, in the later pattern after PEL, AVP synthesized by the remaining functional AVP neurons in the SON, PVN may be released into the circulation directly rather than transported to the neural pituitary for an interruption of the pituitary stalk to maintain the AVP levels in circulation. More importantly, as shown in Fig. 3, there is an enlarged end proximal to the injury site with strongly positive AVP immunostaining. An enlarged pituitary stalk may play roles in helping PEL rats recover from CDI in the 4th phase. These findings may require further studies to confirm the data.

Also, there are also some limitations in this study. First, PEL operation was successfully performed in adult rats, but further investigation is required to determine whether it is suitable for other mammals. Second, the PEL surgery approach is not the same as the clinical surgery approach to deal with sellar disease, which may cause different complications that we cannot detect in this study. Last but not the least, although we targeted at pituitary stalk as precisely as possible by using stereotactic equipment, we could not identify the functional cell type which mediates the CDI condition, as all types of cells at injury sites are affected. To meet these need, cre-loxp gene-editing system, transgenetic method, optogenetics and chemical genetics can be used to investigate the mechanism behind CDI in future research.

The hypothalamus is an important control center for normal physiological functions, and even a slight disturbance may lead to fatal complications. Nevertheless, the survival rate is very high in rats that receive hypothalamic surgery, making them a suitable model for neurological studies. In our study, we assumed that intracranial hematomas in the sellae were the main causes of short-term deaths. In rats that survived for a longer period of time, anhormonia, unconsciousness, and adipsia, a severe situation seen after sellar surgery [7, 16], may result in the loss of initiative to drink water. This feature further induced homeostatic dysfunction, a drastic drop in urine output and an accompanying consciousness disorder, which resulted in a worse prognosis for survival.

In conclusion, we established a stable and reproducible PEL model using a 3D-printed knife and classified the CDI period into 4 phases after surgery with three biological parameters. In addition, we also proposed a CDI index to assess the severity and recovery of CDI in rats. Additionally, MRI and immunostaining of brain slices were used to identify the lesion sites. Our study indicated that complete interruption of the MRI signal, reduction in magnocellular neuron counts and absence of AVP expression in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland could be used as the “gold standard” for successful PEL."
Using systems biology to evaluate targets and mechanism of action of drugs for diabetes comorbidities,"Medications approved for diabetes-associated renal and cardiovascular morbidities and candidate drugs currently in development are subject to substantial variability in drug response. Heterogeneity on a molecular phenotype level is not apparent at clinical presentation, which means that inter-individual differences in drug effect at the molecular level are masked. These findings identify the need for optimising patient phenotyping via use of molecular biomarkers for a personalised therapy approach. Molecular diversity may, on the one hand, result from the effect of genetic polymorphisms on drug transport, metabolism and effective target modulation. Equally relevant, differences may be due to molecular pathologies. The presence of distinct molecular phenotypes is suggested by classifiers aimed at modelling progressive disease. Such functions for prognosis incorporate a complex set of clinical variables or a multitude of molecular markers reflecting a diverse set of molecular disease mechanisms. This information on disease pathology and the mechanism of action of the drug needs to be systematically integrated with data on molecular biomarkers to develop an experimental tool for personalising medicine. The large amount of molecular data available for characterising diabetes-associated morbidities allows for elucidation of molecular process model representations of disease pathologies. Selecting biomarker candidates on such grounds and, in turn identifying their association with progressive disease allows for the identification of molecular processes associated with disease progression. The molecular effect of a drug can also be modelled at a molecular process level, and the integration of disease pathology and drug effect molecular models reveals candidate biomarkers for assessing drug response. Such tools serve as enrichment strategies aimed at adding precision to drug development and use.","Modelling disease pathology and drug mechanism of action on a molecular pathway and process level, and studying biomarker candidates using molecular model interference is a generic procedure broadly expandable to pathologies and drug classes. A key element of this approach is the elucidation of solid molecular biomarker panel data on disease progression together with assignment to molecular processes, be it from rational selection on the basis of process model coverage combined with subsequent experimental testing, or molecular process assignment of biomarkers e.g. derived from explorative profiling approaches. Clinically, such biomarkers support identification of specific molecular phenotypes of progressive disease to expand our understanding of clinical variable variance in relation to outcome. In a translational manner, molecular process information allows for the selection of drug targets embedded in relevant molecular processes, as well as identifying potential interference of molecular mechanisms associated with drug action."
FINE-CKD model to evaluate economic value of finerenone in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes,"Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and irreversible disease often associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). CKD is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular (CV) events, increased mortality, and diminished quality of life. Finerenone is a new treatment for patients with CKD and T2D that delays CKD progression and reduces CV complications.

Objective: To describe the approach and structure of a costeffectiveness model for finerenone for patients with CKD and T2D and compare it with existing economic models in CKD.

Methods: A de novo cost-effectiveness model (FINE-CKD model), reflective of FIDELIO-DKD results, was developed for finerenone. The FINE-CKD model was designed and implemented in accordance with published guidance on modeling and was developed with input from economic and clinical experts. The final model approach was evaluated against existing modeling structures in CKD identified through a systematic literature review.

Results and conclusions: The FINE-CKD model structure follows recommended modeling guidelines and has been designed in accordance with the best practices of modeling in CKD, while also incorporating important features of the FIDELIO-DKD design and results. The approach is consistent with the published literature, ensuring transparency and minimizing uncertainty that can arise from unnecessary complexity. The FINE-CKD model allows for reliable assessment of benefits and costs related to the use of finerenone in patients with CKD and T2D, and it is a reliable assessment of cost-effectiveness.","Several findings from the literature review presented here warrant discussion in the context of the cost-effectiveness model developed for finerenone in the treatment of patients with CKD and T2D (ie, FINE-CKD model).

The identified approaches to model CKD progression all follow the same general model structure whether the population is patients with CKD or patients with diabetes. CKD progression modeling is the most detailed in models focused on CKD patients. In diabetes models, which also include CKD submodels, the structure is similar, but include additional considerations related to diabetes (eg, glycemia) and its complications. As finerenone does not impact T2D progression or glycemia-related parameters, the use of a diabetes model would add unnecessary complexity, while also leading to an oversimplification of CKD progression. Indeed, these models overwhelmingly assume a constant decrease of eGFR, as in the ECHO-T2DM model, which does not reflect natural fluctuations of eGFR over time, as observed in FIDELIO-DKD,13 and lacks granularity. Such an approach potentially results in an imprecise estimation of how eGFR changes through time, which could have important impacts on the accrual of costs and outcomes related to CKD progression.

Our systematic review confirms previous conclusions by Sugrue et al,23 who assert that published models typically utilize frameworks based on either eGFR and/or albuminuria, with 2 core structures identified (ie, microsimulation models and cohort-level Markov models using CKD stages to capture disease progression) and with patient trajectories represented as a series of transitions from one CKD stage to another. Sugrue et al advocate for prediction of individual patients’ eGFR trajectories (ie, patient-level models used to capture the heterogeneity of CKD progression clinical course), which may vary substantially across patients and may be influenced by various risk factors, including CV disease and diabetes. Although such heterogeneity may pose challenges to model CKD progression accurately, a Markovian structure considering these factors has been proven to be sufficient in many of the existing models. Given that a Markov modeling approach at the cohort level is able to capture the key considerations, it is preferred to patient-level simulations, since the latter are more difficult to populate and review.15 Based on these factors, the use of a Markov framework in the FINE-CKD model is justified.

As demonstrated by FIDELIO-DKD,13 finerenone is expected to have a CV benefit, as evident in the observed reduction in the risk of a composite end point of time to first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF by 14% over 2.6 years. Moreover, it was shown in the trial that finerenone delays CKD progression and reduces the risk of renal events, including ESKD. The impact of finerenone on these outcomes can be captured in the FINE-CKD model in an appropriate way due to the inclusion of relevant model health states. These health states are implemented to reflect the main stages in the patients’ disease progression. As the cardiorenal protective properties of finerenone result in delayed progression of CKD and reduced occurrence of CV events, it is important that the FINE-CKD model considers both renal and CV outcomes in the list of health states. As in many identified models, and in line with KDIGO guidelines, the kidney health states were defined according to CKD stage and history of CV events. Indeed, 12 of 22 models consider CV events and include them as separate health states. As in the existing models, different CKD stages from G1 to G5 are considered in the FINE-CKD model. Stage G3 could have been additionally divided into 2 categories; however, this was rarely done in the previous models, and in cases where it was, the disaggregation was most often accompanied by application of the same inputs regarding both resource use and QOL for CKD stages 3a and 3b.

Although adequate modeling of the impact of finerenone on CKD and associated risks is inherently complex, a range of simplifications were applied relative to some of the existing CKD models. Among these, albuminuria is not included explicitly in the model as was the case, for example, in a UK HTA Assessment Study.17 No separate health states for different types of dialysis or CV events are considered in the FINE-CKD model, while both of these were included by Go et al.16 These simplifications have been undertaken in the FINE-CKD model for practical reasons, and their impact on model results can be assessed via sensitivity analysis. At the same time, a detailed application of the results of FIDELIO-DKD is considered in the FINE-CKD model by taking full advantage of their granularity in terms of eGFR changes over time. Indeed, the FINE-CKD model considers a relatively short model cycle and allows for all possible transitions between CKD stages, whereas the focus was solely on the deterioration of the disease in the majority of the existing models.

In conclusion, the FINE-CKD model has been built in accordance with the general practice of modeling in CKD with appropriate focus on the incorporation of the FIDELIO-DKD trial results. Hence, the FINE-CKD model accurately reflects reality in terms of the natural history of CKD while also allowing for reliable assessment of benefits and costs related to the use of finerenone in patients with CKD and T2D. The structure of the FINE-CKD model is that which most adequately addresses the decision problem posed, making the model transparent and reducing uncertainty related to unnecessary complexity. This is, at the same time, the most used and well-validated model type and structure in the published literature, as evident from the systematic literature review described above. Together, these considerations lend substantial weight to the approach of the FINE-CKD model and support its use in assessing the cost-effectiveness of finerenone in patients with CKD and T2D.

Longitudinal progression of diabetes mellitus in Wolfram syndrome: The Washington University Wolfram Research Clinic experience,"Objective: (1) Describe the progression of diabetes mellitus over time in an observational study of Wolfram syndrome, a rare, genetic, neurodegenerative disorder, which often includes diabetes mellitus and is typically diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. (2) Determine whether C-peptide could be used as a marker of diabetes progression in interventional trials for Wolfram syndrome.

Methods: N = 44 (25F/19M) participants with genetically confirmed Wolfram syndrome attended the Washington University Wolfram Research Clinic annually from 2010 to 2019. Medical history, physical examinations, blood sampling, and questionnaires were used to collect data about diabetes mellitus and other components of Wolfram syndrome. Beta-cell function was assessed by determination of C-peptide during a mixed meal tolerance test. Random coefficients models evaluated the rate of progression of C-peptide over time, and power analyses were used to estimate the number of subjects needed to detect a change in C-peptide decline during an intervention trial.

Results: 93.2% of patients had diabetes mellitus. Mean HbA1c across all study visits was 7.9%. C-peptide significantly decreased with increasing duration of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.0001); an optimal break point in C-peptide decline was identified to occur between 0.1 and 2.3 years after diabetes mellitus diagnosis. Twenty patients per group (active vs. control) were estimated to be needed to detect a 60% slowing of C-peptide decline during the first 2.3 years following diabetes diagnosis.

Conclusion: C-peptide declines over time in Wolfram syndrome and could potentially be used as a marker of diabetes progression in interventional studies for Wolfram syndrome, especially within the first 2 years after diabetes diagnosis.
","This study first aimed to describe the course of diabetes mellitus in Wolfram syndrome. A large majority of our sample with Wolfram syndrome had diabetes mellitus (93.2%), with an average HbA1c of 7.9%. C-peptide clearly declined in patients with Wolfram syndrome with an optimal break point in decline between 0.1 and 2.3 years after diabetes diagnosis. However, interestingly, there was no clear statistically significant plateau at which C-peptide no longer changed after reaching an optimal breakpoint (i.e., C-peptide continued to decline). This is in contrast to type 1 diabetes mellitus populations described in the literature, which have been shown to have an exponential fall in C-peptide measured via urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR) over 7 years followed by a stable plateau in C-peptide levels28. Thus, C-peptide could potentially decline more rapidly in Wolfram syndrome patients, but residual beta-cell function may persist longer than in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus; however, given the different methodologies used between studies, future research is needed to directly compare C-peptide decline in Wolfram syndrome and type 1 diabetes using identical methodology.

The current study also aimed to determine if beta-cell function could be used as a marker of diabetes progression in patients with Wolfram syndrome. Power analyses estimated that in subjects beginning an intervention trial within 2.3 years of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, a sample size of only 30–20 per group would be needed to detect a 50%−60% slowing in the rate of C-peptide decline. A total of n=14 (34%) participants with both Wolfram syndrome and diabetes mellitus in the current sample had a diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome within 2.3 years of a diabetes mellitus diagnosis.

Given these results, there are numerous considerations to be made when considering beta-cell function as a marker of disease progression in interventional trials for Wolfram syndrome. First, lower differences in the rate of C-peptide decline may also be meaningful and more feasible (e.g., 25% slowing); however, it would require more subjects which may be challenging given the rarity of the syndrome. The recruitment challenges for an interventional trial using beta-cell function also highlight the crucial importance of collaborative efforts across national and international centers that have expertise with Wolfram syndrome. However, the sample size required for C-peptide is much more feasible than those calculated for other Wolfram syndrome manifestations such as hearing loss, which was shown to require 75 subjects with sensorineural hearing loss to detect a 50% slowing7. Third, the results highlight the importance of early diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome. Not only would early diagnosis help in using beta-cell function as a marker of diabetes progression, but early diagnosis of monogenetic forms of diabetes could help families and health care teams develop treatment and support plans tailored to improve quality of life for the patient. Thus, endocrinologists should further evaluate youth with autoimmune negative diabetes to determine any underlying causes that might require a unique treatment plan for the patient (e.g., skills training programs for those with vision or hearing loss). Lastly, it is important to note that even if an intervention slows the progression of diabetes, it may or may not be relevant for the more devastating neurological features of Wolfram syndrome.

There are study limitations to be considered. The sample size was limited given the rarity of the disease. In addition, it is likely that many patients with Wolfram syndrome may not manifest other features of the syndrome for years after the initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and, therefore, may not be diagnosed with Wolfram syndrome until after the first few years of diabetes mellitus (e.g., only n=8 in the current sample were recruited within 2.3 years after diabetes mellitus diagnosis). Second, the inclusion criteria may also have biased the sample given that subjects had to have the resources and ability to travel to Washington University in St. Louis for participation. The sample also includes a younger population given that early-onset subjects were specifically recruited for the clinic to increase the likelihood of a more detectable progression and description of the natural history of Wolfram syndrome over time; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to older populations. It should be noted that the median age of onset of diabetes mellitus in our cohort was 5–6 years old and there was minimal C-peptide remaining after 8–10 years of diabetes mellitus; thus, few adults with Wolfram syndrome will still have adequate C-peptide to use as a marker in a clinical trial. Lastly, given that the current study only measured HbA1c once annually at the clinic, a comprehensive measure of cumulative glycemic exposure over time could not be obtained and could potentially be a determinant of the rate of C-peptide decline.

Overall, the current study suggests that beta-cell function could potentially be a useful marker of progression if restricted to Wolfram syndrome subjects early in the course of diabetes mellitus. This could have important implications for Wolfram syndrome as researchers seek to develop novel pharmacological treatments to improve or slow the progression of the condition."
Classification of diagnostic subcategories for obesity and diabetes based on eating patterns,"Aim: To investigate whether eating patterns of specific food groups can be used to predict and classify Mexican adults who have been diagnosed as having obesity, diabetes or both, when compared to those without a diagnosis. Additionally, we aim to show the benefit of data mining techniques in nutritional studies.

Methods: Statistical analysis of self-reported eating patterns based on designated food groups is conducted. Predictive models for health status based on dietary patterns are built using a naïve Bayes classifier.

Results: Clear patterns emerge in the model building where adults are categorised as having obesity, diabetes or both. The model for diabetics showed the greatest degree of predictability, producing sensitivity results 2.4 times higher than the average, using score decile testing. The models for people with obesity and for those with both obesity and diabetes both reported sensitivity doubling the average. Coverage also showed greatest response for the diabetic model, the first decile containing 24% of all diabetics.

Conclusions: Classifier models using dietary habits as inputs succeed in subcategorising Mexican adults based on health status. Diabetics are associated with a very different, and more appropriate dietary pattern (significantly less sugar consumption) for their condition, relative to the non-diagnosed group. Adults with obesity are also associated with a very different, but inappropriate (higher overall consumption), dietary pattern. We hypothesise that obesity, unlike diabetes, is not seen as a sufficiently serious condition, leading to an inadequate response to the diagnosis. Furthermore, data mining techniques can provide new results in nutritional studies.",
[A proposed model of the treatment of diabetes mellitus in pregnancy],A model of management of pregnant diabetic patients is proposed. Such a model has been implemented at the Voivodeship Out-patient Clinic for Diabetics. Proposed model includes recent data on diabetes mellitus complications and the effect of coexisting diseases on the mother and fetus health. Management was adapted to the real and potential possibilities of health service in Poland. A decrease in the rate of mortality of fetuses under 7% was achieved. It is worth emphasizing despite higher value than those reported in the literature.,

Role of protein aggregation and degradation in autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus,"This review focuses on the cellular and molecular aspects underlying familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI), a rare disorder that is usually transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion. The disease, manifesting in infancy or early childhood and gradually progressing in severity, is caused by fully penetrant heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding prepro-vasopressin-neurophysin II, the precursor of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). Post mortem studies in affected adults have shown cell degeneration in vasopressinergic hypothalamic nuclei. Studies in cells expressing pathogenic mutants and knock-in rodent models have shown that the mutant precursors are folding incompetent and fail to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as occurs normally with proteins that have entered the regulated secretory pathway. A portion of these mutants is eliminated via ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by proteasomes after retrotranslocation to the cytosol. Another portion forms large disulfide-linked fibrillar aggregates within the ER, in which wild-type precursor is trapped. Aggregation capacity is independently conferred by two domains of the prohormone, namely the AVP moiety and the C-terminal glycopeptide (copeptin). The same domains are also required for packaging into dense-core secretory granules and regulated secretion, suggesting a disturbed balance between the physiological self-aggregation at the trans-Golgi network and avoiding premature aggregate formation at the ER in the disease. The critical role of ERAD in maintaining physiological water balance has been underscored by experiments in mice expressing wild-type AVP but lacking critical components of the ERAD machinery. These animals also develop DI and show amyloid-like aggregates in the ER lumen. Thus, the capacity of the ERAD is exceeded in autosomal dominant DI, which can be viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the formation of amyloid ER aggregates. While DI symptoms develop prior to detectable cell death in transgenic DI mice, the eventual loss of vasopressinergic neurons is accompanied by autophagy, but the mechanism leading to cell degeneration in autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal DI still remains unknown.",
Smoking and Diabetes Control in Adults With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: A Nationwide Study From the 2018 National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran,"Objectives: Smoking is among the top leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, studies on the association between smoking and diabetes complications and metabolic control have shown conflicting results. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of smoking with micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes and lipid and glycemic indices.

Methods: We used the National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran database of 99,651 adult patients with diabetes across Iran. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between smoking and diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy. This association was adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, medication, obesity and type of diabetes.

Results: Smoking was associated with cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy (odds ratios [ORs] for patients with type 1 diabetes were 1.51, 2.29, 2.70 and 2.40, respectively; for patients with type 2 diabetes, ORs were 1.27, 1.21, 1.51 and 1.70, respectively; all with p values <0.001). Among patients with type 1 diabetes, smoking was significantly (p<0.05) associated with A1C (OR, 2.12), 2-h postglucose level (OR, 1.30), triglycerides (OR, 1.48) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) control (OR, 1.34). Among patients with type 2 diabetes, smoking was significantly associated with A1C (OR, 1.09) and HDL control (OR, 1.21).

Conclusions: Smoking was associated with multiple diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy and worse A1C and HDL control in both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It was also associated with worse 2-h postglucose level and triglyceride control among patients with type 1 diabetes. Our findings signify that national programs for smoking prevention and cessation may be beneficial to diabetes control in Iran.",
Animal models of diabetic microvascular complications: Relevance to clinical features,"Diabetes has become more common in recent years worldwide, and this growth is projected to continue in the future. The primary concern with diabetes is developing various complications, which significantly contribute to the disease's mortality and morbidity. Over time, the condition progresses from the pre-diabetic to the diabetic stage and then to the development of complications. Years and enormous resources are required to evaluate pharmacological interventions to prevent or delay the progression of disease or complications in humans. Appropriate screening models are required to gain a better understanding of both pathogenesis and potential therapeutic agents. Different species of animals are used to evaluate the pharmacological potentials and study the pathogenesis of the disease. Animal models are essential for research because they represent most of the structural, functional, and biochemical characteristics of human diseases. An ideal screening model should mimic the pathogenesis of the disease with identifiable characteristics. A thorough understanding of animal models is required for the experimental design to select an appropriate model. Each animal model has certain advantages and limitations. The present manuscript describes the animal models and their diagnostic characteristics to evaluate microvascular diabetic complications.","Despite the availability of a number of animal models for screening of pharmacological activity, the selection of the most suitable model is incomprehensive. Due to their availability, ease of handling and cost, Rodents are most frequently used for the screening of diabetic complications. Moreover, the pathogenic characteristics present in rodents mirror the course of disease in humans, still due to some of the lacking features, the outcome from these animal models is considered diabolic. To overcome these issues, the use of transgenic models for pharmacological screening has gained the edge where most of these “missing features” are present. Moreover, the use of zebrafish nowadays is considered as a “full platter” with the availability of almost all the features of microvascular complications of diabetes. It is fast, flexible, and inexpensive and enables high throughput analyses and screenings and can resemble phenotypes of other animal models (mice and rats) in a shorter time period. Moreover, this model also offers sophisticated imaging techniques for analysis and allow simple and fast genetic and pharmacological approaches with high throughput technique. Therefore, Zebra Fish model is considered as the most appropriate and advanced models for the screening of diabetic retinopathy, whereas rodent models do not mimic the features present in case of human diabetic retinopathy.

In the case of diabetic nephropathy, rodent models are considered the most appropriate model for evaluating diabetic nephropathy due to easy genetic manipulation, low cost, short gestation times, and high genetic homology with humans. Zebra fish is associated with several disadvantages for the evaluation of diabetic nephropathy i.e. primitive renal cells in Zebrafish are clearly functionally very different to humans and zebrafish live in an aquatic habitat, screening of some water-soluble drugs in zebrafish is another limitation. Rodent models are considered most appropriate for the pharmacological evaluation of diabetic neuropathy due to several factors like rodents show behavioral, functional, structural and molecular biomarkers as that of humans. Moreover, ease in handling and maintenance of animals are some of the additional factors that make rodent models the most suitable models for evaluating diabetic neuropathy.

Still, the use of large animals like monkeys and dogs is considered a concluding remark in drug discovery, but cost and handling are some of the issues associated with large animals. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate model which can depict all the pathogenic features of diabetic complications in humans is essential for the requirement for an ideal animal model.

Animal models of Central Diabetes Insipidus: Human relevance of acquired beyond hereditary syndromes and the role of oxytocin,"The aim of this study was to review different animal models of Central Diabetes Insipidus, a neurobiological syndrome characterized by the excretion of copious amounts of diluted urine (polyuria), a consequent water intake (polydipsia), and a rise in the serum sodium concentration (hypernatremia). In rodents, Central Diabetes Insipidus can be caused by genetic disorders (Brattleboro rats) but also by various traumatic/surgical interventions, including neurohypophysectomy, pituitary stalk compression, hypophysectomy, and median eminence lesions. Regardless of its etiology, Central Diabetes Insipidus affects the neuroendocrine system that secretes arginine vasopressin, a neurohormone responsible for antidiuretic functions that acts trough the renal system. However, most Central Diabetes Insipidus models also show disorders in other neurobiological systems, specifically in the secretion of oxytocin, a neurohormone involved in body sodium excretion. Although the hydromineral behaviors shown by the different Central Diabetes Insipidus models have usually been considered as very similar, the present review highlights relevant differences with respect to these behaviors as a function of the individual neurobiological systems affected. Increased understanding of the relationship between the neuroendocrine systems involved and the associated hydromineral behaviors may allow appropriate action to be taken to correct these behavioral neuroendocrine deficits.

Review of erectile dysfunction in diabetic animal models,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common, male sexual disorder that has a negative impact on the quality of life of men and their sexual partners. The prevalence of ED in diabetic men is ≥ 50%. Animal models provide a valuable perspective in the investigation of ED. Most basic science studies have utilized the rodent model of type 1 diabetes. However, an animal model for type 2 diabetes-associated ED requires verification. The streptozotocin (STZ) induced type 1 diabetic model has contributed to significant advancement in the study of ED. A Medline search using the keywords ""diabetic animals and ED"" was performed, and available peer-reviewed English articles between 2007-2013 were evaluated. The proposed mechanisms for developing ED in diabetics include: hyperglycemia, impaired nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway dysfunction, increased levels of reactive free-radicals, up-regulation of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway, and neuropathic damage. The current treatment regimen of diabetes-induced ED is multimodal. Modification of comorbidities and, specifically, rectifying the underlying hyperglycemia is vital to prevent or halt progression of the disease. Further research on the basic mechanisms of ED and additional studies using better animal models of ED associated with type 1 and 2 diabetes are needed. Preclinical studies using the diabetic animal model will likely provide further insight for intervention and prevention strategies for diabetic ED treatment.",
Developmental programming and diabetes - The human experience and insight from animal models,"Children born to mothers, rather than to fathers, with type 1 diabetes (type 1 DM) or type 2 diabetes (type 2 DM) may have a greater susceptibility to diabetes and obesity in later life, inferring a role for in utero or early post-natal influences on the developing child. This review summarises the studies contributing to this hypothesis, noting some of the controversies including the potential for residual confounding and the influence of maternal BMI. Animal models demonstrate that maternal hyperglycaemia leads to persistent disorders of offspring pancreatic β cell secretory capacity, abnormal insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive tissues and abnormal development of the hypothalamus, associated with aberrant control of energy regulation and obesity in adult life. Prospective studies, particularly follow-up of children born to diabetic mothers participating in RCTs of improved glycemic control are needed to accurately assess the transgenerational influences of maternal diabetes and to evaluate mechanisms inferred from animal data.
","Animal models of diabetes have shown unequivocally that maternal diabetes has persistent influences on offspring metabolic function. β cell function is perturbed and the offspring may become obese. These models offer the potential to better define the relative roles of maternal obesity and diabetes which present a confused picture in the human literature. Attention should be paid to potential ‘programming’ role of maternal insulin resistance and adipokines, and to the role of placental function "
Mouse model of inducible nephrogenic diabetes insipidus produced by floxed aquaporin-2 gene deletion,"Transgenic mouse models of defective urinary concentrating ability produced by deletion of various membrane transport or receptor proteins, including aquaporin-2 (AQP2), are associated with neonatal mortality from polyuria. Here, we report an inducible mouse model of AQP2 gene deletion with severe polyuria in adult mice. LoxP sequences were inserted into introns 1 and 2 in the mouse AQP2 gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mating of germ-line AQP2-loxP mice with tamoxifen-inducible Cre-expressing mice produced offspring with inducible homozygous Cre-AQP2-loxP, which had a normal phenotype. Tamoxifen injections over 10 days resulted in AQP2 gene excision, with undetectable full-length AQP2 transcript in kidney and a >95% reduction in immunoreactive AQP2 protein. Urine osmolality decreased from approximately 2,000 to <500 mosmol/kgH(2)O after 4-5 days, with urine output increasing from 2 to 25 ml/day. Urine osmolality did not increase after water deprivation. Interestingly, AQP3 protein expression in the collecting duct was increased by about fivefold after AQP2 gene excision. Mild renal damage was seen after 6 wk of polyuria, with collecting duct dilatation, yet normal creatinine clearance and serum chemistries. These results establish the first adult model of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) caused by AQP2 deficiency, with daily urine output comparable to body weight, although remarkable preservation of renal function compared with non-inducible NDI models.","We report here the first inducible mouse model of NDI. The motivation for this work was the neonatal mortality seen in several noninducible models of NDI, as reviewed in the introduction. A surviving adult mouse model of NDI has applications for the study of the pathophysiology of NDI in mice and for the evaluation of the in vivo efficacy of NDI therapies such as molecular and chemical chaperones. Our strategy was the introduction of LoxP sites into the mouse AQP2 gene by targeted gene replacement in ES cells and inducible excision of LoxP-flanked gene sequences in adult mice. The LoxP insertions in introns 1 and 2 did not affect AQP2 gene expression or function, as non-tamoxifen-treated homozygous AQP2flox mice carrying the Cre/Esr1 transgene had a normal phenotype and AQP2 protein expression. After evaluating several Cre-recombinase-expressing mice, including TgN (Mx1-Cre) (Jackson Laboratories), we found adequate collecting duct Cre expression in Cre/Esr1 mice to efficiently excise the LoxP-flanked AQP2 gene sequence and reduce renal AQP2 protein expression to near zero.

Because the Cre/Esr1 fusion protein is expressed in all cells of homozygous AQP2flox mice, the efficiency of AQP2 gene excision depends in part on tissue/cell-specific tamoxifen delivery. Strong Cre-recombinase activity has been shown in Cre/Esr1 mice in highly vascular tissues following intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen, including in brain, heart, kidney, lung, pancreas, and intestine (10). However, Cre-recombinase activity was lower and variable in liver. In our study, >90% of AQP2 gene excision was found in kidneys of tamoxifen-treated homozygous AQP2flox mice, with near complete absence of full-length AQP2 transcript by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis, and absent AQP2 protein by immunoblot analysis. The efficient renal AQP2 gene excision may be due, in part, to the excellent tamoxifen penetration in collecting duct epithelial cells from both their blood- and urine-facing surfaces.

Tamoxifen-treated AQP2flox adult mice developed a severe urinary concentrating defect with marked polyuria, urine hyposmolality, and unresponsiveness to water deprivation. This pattern of NDI is substantially more severe and differs from that in other aquaporin knockout mouse models. Mice lacking AQP1 manifest relatively mild polyuria with daily urine output of 5–6 ml, urine osmolality of 500–600 mosmol/kgH2O, and vasopressin insensitivity (19). The NDI in AQP1 null mice is due to a combination of defective near-isosmolar fluid absorption in the proximal tubule (31) and defective countercurrent multiplication produced by reduced water permeability in thin descending limb of Henle (3) and outer medullary descending vasa recta (27). Mice lacking AQP7, which is expressed only in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule, have little if any defect in urinary concentrating ability (32). AQP3 null mice, which have reduced water permeability in collecting duct basolateral membrane, also manifest NDI with low urine osmolality (260 mosmol/kgH2O) and moderate polyuria (8 ml/day), but with partial vasopressin sensitivity (17). Thus, as is generally believed, the luminal membrane in collecting duct epithelial cells normally constitutes the rate-limiting barrier for transcellular water transport. AQP4 null mice, which have reduced water permeability in the inner medullary collecting duct, manifest only a mild urinary concentrating defect (18), because in antidiuresis the majority of fluid leaving the ascending limb is absorbed in the cortical collecting duct.

Our previous analysis of AQP2-T126M mutant mice indicated a critical role of AQP2 in neonatal renal function (39). Mice were polyuric and unresponsive to vasopressin and manifested rapidly progressive renal insufficiency with papillary atrophy and death within 6 days after birth. As expected from cell culture experiments (35), AQP1-T126M protein was retained at the endoplasmic reticulum in collecting duct principal cells of the homozygous mutant mice. It was not possible to examine effects of “correctors” of AQP2-T126M cellular processing because of the early neonatal pathology. The inducible AQP2 null mice generated here, when appropriately mated with AQP2-T126M knock-in mice, are predicted to generate conditional knock-in mice suitable for such studies. Adult mice with AQP2-T126M expression would be produced by deletion of the wild-type AQP2 allele in hemozygous mice having one inducible wild-type AQP2 allele and one AQP2-T126M mutant allele. Recently, AQP2-F204V mutant mice were identified by forward genetic screening of ethylnitrosourea-mutagenized mice (14). AQP2-F204V is a relatively mild mutation compared with AQP2-T126M (or the null mutant), permitting these mice to survive beyond the neonatal period with a milder form of NDI. When additional mouse models of AQP2 mutation become available, it will be interesting to compare collecting duct water permeability with urinary concentrating function and vasopressin sensitivity.

Studies of renal aquaporin expression indicated significant upregulation of AQP3 transcript and protein in tamoxifen-treated homozygous AQP2flox mice but no differences in the expression of AQP1, AQP4, AQP6, and AQP7. Prior studies have shown increased AQP3 expression by vasopressin (4, 37), although not as high as found here. Interestingly, polyuria significantly reduced AQP3 expression in some rat models, including water-loading (24), bilateral ureteral obstruction (13), hypercalcemia (38), and lithium administration (29). In the present study, tamoxifen-treated AQP2flox mice have marked polyuria, likely associated with chronically elevated serum vasopressin concentration and hence AQP3 upregulation.

A secondary purpose of this study was to evaluate extrarenal AQP2 expression. Previous studies have reported AQP2 expression in the rat inner ear (21), colon (9), testis (25), and vas deferens (33). In the rat inner ear, AQP2 expression in the endolymphatic sac was found to be increased by vasopressin (30) and proposed to play a important role vestibular function and possibly in the pathogenesis of Meniere's disease. Immunocytochemistry in rat testis showed constitutive AQP2 expression in apical membrane of distal vas deferens principal cells (33). The significance of these observations is unclear as NDI subjects with AQP2 mutations have no impairment of vestibular or reproductive functions. AQP2 expression has also been reported in the apical membrane of rat distal colon epithelium (9). Utilizing tamoxifen-treated AQP2flox mice as a control, AQP2 transcript expression was found in mouse kidney, inner ear, testes, and vas deferens, but not in colon.

In summary, we have generated and characterized the first inducible mouse model of severe NDI. Unlike prior models of noninducible NDI, adult mice with severe polyuria are able to thrive for more than 6 wk without plasma/urine evidence of renal insufficiency. The strategy of inducible gene deletion should thus be useful in generating mice suitable for testing of therapeutic strategies aimed at correcting defective proteins causing human NDI."
A simple economic evaluation model for selecting diabetes health care strategies,"The aim of this work was to develop a simple model to evaluate the health care cost of diabetes in order to help decision-makers in selecting strategies for the prevention, control, and treatment of the disease. The model assesses the cost of full coverage of health care of diabetic patients free of chronic complications and in comparison with those of the treatment of acute and chronic complications. For that purpose, standardized cost figures were obtained from both annual control and treatment of uncomplicated diabetic patients and the treatment of one episode of ketoacidosis, acute myocardial infarction, and amputation of two toes. The treatment/prevention cost ratio obtained showed that prevention of a single episode of any of these late-complication-related events would provide enough funds to cover either the total or partial annual cost of control and treatment of several uncomplicated diabetic patients. These facts would favour the allocation of funds in such a way as to allow adequate control and treatment of diabetic patients to keep them free of the chronic complications of the disease. This would be a wise investment of funds, which would result in a reduction in the socioeconomic cost of the disease and in a better quality of life for the diabetic patients and their families.",
Aquaporin 2 mutations in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,"Water reabsorption in the renal collecting duct is regulated by the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP). When the vasopressin V2 receptor, present on the basolateral site of the renal principal cell, becomes activated by AVP, aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels will be inserted in the apical membrane, and in this fashion, water can be reabsorbed from the pro-urine into the interstitium. The essential role of the vasopressin V2 receptor and AQP2 in the maintenance of body water homeostasis became clear when it was shown that mutations in their genes cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a disorder in which the kidney is unable to concentrate urine in response to AVP. This review describes the current knowledge on AQP2 mutations in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",
A mini-review of pharmacological strategies used to ameliorate polyuria associated with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by renal resistance to the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which leads to polyuria, plasma hyperosmolarity, polydipsia, and impaired quality of living. Inherited forms are caused by X-linked loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) or autosomal recessive/dominant mutations in the gene encoding aquaporin 2 (AQP2). A common acquired form is lithium-induced NDI. AVP facilitates reabsorption of water through increased abundance and insertion of AQP2 in the apical membrane of principal cells in the collecting ducts. In X-linked NDI, V2R is dysfunctional, which leads to impaired water reabsorption. These patients have functional AQP2, and thus the challenge is to achieve AQP2 membrane insertion independently of V2R. The current treatment is symptomatic and is based on distally acting diuretics (thiazide or amiloride) and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin). This mini-review covers published data from trials in preclinical in vivo models and a few human intervention studies to improve NDI by more causal approaches. Promising effects on NDI in preclinical studies have been demonstrated by the use of pharmacological approaches with secretin, Wnt5a, protein kinase A agonist, fluconazole, prostaglandin E2 EP2 and EP4 agonists, statins, metformin, and soluble prorenin receptor agonists. In patients, only casuistic reports have evaluated the effect of statins, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (rolipram and sildenafil), and the guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat without amelioration of symptoms. It is concluded that there is currently no established intervention that causally improves symptoms or quality of life in patients with NDI. There is a need to collaborate to improve study quality and conduct formal trials.","Experimental animal models mimicking human X-linked NDI have been used to test ability of pharmacological compounds to ameliorate the symptoms of NDI. However, it is necessary to consider potential side effects of the treatment strategies when transferring to a human setting. Few studies were performed using pharmacological therapy appropriate for direct translation into human interventional studies. Translation of preclinical data into clinical trials has been sparse and with predominantly negative results (Fig. 3). There is an unmet need for improved treatment regimens in NDI. In recent years, there has been a global interest in repurposing previously approved drugs for new indications, which may significantly reduce both costs and efforts associated with drug approval (47). In that respect, the animal studies using fluconazole may hold the promise of feasible interventional trials in patients with congenital NDI. Likewise, conclusive results regarding effects of metformin in the treatment of hereditary NDI are lacking. An interesting approach, which is currently unexplored in humans, would be to combine treatments directed at different targets. For example, a combination of V2R-independent drugs, i.e., secretin or PGE2 EP4 receptor agonists combined with a statin or fluconazole, could have an additive effect. An important challenge in NDI research is gathering the sufficient number of participants to perform conclusive clinical trials. Furthermore, consideration should be paid to selecting sufficiently high dosages of drugs, fully or partially eliminated by filtration, due to the observation that patients with NDI often have an elevated renal plasma clearance. We encourage international collaborations in future interventional trials. In light of promising results from preclinical studies, a dedicated effort to perform sufficiently powered translational clinical trials may provide the long-awaited breakthrough in the management of patients with NDI."
[Diabetes mellitus and early failures in oral implantology],"It has become increasingly common for diabetic patients to be considered as candidates for dental implants. However even though success rates of implant therapy in diabetic are high, this does not preclude failures. Failure to osseointegrate in the initial healing phase results in a fibrous tissue encapsulation of the implant and clinical mobility, leading ultimately to the failure of the implant. This review presents the current knowledge regarding the effect of diabetes mellitus on the osseointegration of implants including pathophysiologic aspects as well as their potential implications on bone metabolism and osseointegration, implant success rate at the second-phase surgery and guidelines for pre and post-operative management. In experimental models of diabetes mellitus, a reduced level of bone-implant contact has been shown, and this can be reversed by means of treatment with insulin. Compared with the general population, a higher failure rate is seen in diabetic patients. Most of these occur at the second-phase surgery, seemingly pointing to the microvascular complications of this condition as a possible causal factor. It is necessary to take certain special considerations into account for the placement of implants in diabetic patient. A good control of plasma glycemia, together with other measures, has been shown to improve the percentages of implant survival in these patients.",
Diabetes and number of years of life lost with and without cardiovascular disease: a multi-state homogeneous semi-Markov model,"Aims
We quantified the impact of type 2 diabetes on incidence of non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, considering CVD as a continuum from occurrence of diabetes to the end point, and estimated the 15-year life expectancy with and without CVD.

Methods
A total of 7239 Iranian adults (3246 men), aged ≥ 30 years, were followed from 1999 to 2014. We applied a multi-state semi-Markov model with three transitions including CVD-free to non-fatal CVD, CVD-free to death and non-fatal CVD to death, and studied the influence of diabetes on each transition rate, stratifying by sex and adjusting for confounders.

Results
Diabetes was significantly associated with increased risk of non-fatal CVD in men [hazard ratio, 1.70 (1.36–3.53)] and women [2.19 (1.74–2.77)], and of all-cause death [2.72 (2.03–3.63) and 1.92 (1.37–2.67) in men and women, respectively]. An increased risk of mortality was found only among diabetic men, when non-fatal CVD was occurred [2.19 (1.36–3.53)]. Men with diabetes experienced first non-fatal CVD and death without CVD 1.7 and 1.4 years, respectively, earlier than those without diabetes; the corresponding values were 1.4 and 0.7 years for women. Moreover, diabetic men lived 1.3 years less than non-diabetic counterparts when non-fatal CVD was occurred.

Conclusions
Diabetes increased the risk of non-fatal CVD events and all-cause mortality and consequently decreased the number of years lived without CVD. A decrease in LE was found only among diabetic men compared to non-diabetics after non-fatal CVD occurred.
","We found that diabetes was associated with higher risk of CVD and all-cause mortality which can be translated to a 1.5 years early onset of CVD among diabetic subjects. Furthermore, about 11 months decrease was shown in lifetime years spent with and without CVD among diabetic compared to non-diabetic patients. However, this decrease was influenced mainly by CVD events among diabetic men."
Modeling long-term diabetes and related complications in rats,"Introduction: Accurate preclinical modeling of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy is crucial to enable the development of novel preventative therapies. The aims of this study were to establish a model of long-term diabetes with sustained medium scale hyperglycemia and characterize the pathological changes detectable after 4months, with particular respect to dependence on the degree of hyperglycemia.

Methods: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic CFY rats were subjected to four different insulin substitution protocols to achieve different levels of glycemic control (Diabetic 1-4 groups). Eyes were investigated by ophthalmoscopy, kidney function by urine analysis, and neuropathy by functional tests. Retinal and renal morphological evaluations were performed by histology, immuno-histochemistry and electron microscopy.

Results: Rats of the Diabetic 3 group showed massive hyperglycemia-dependent anterior segment neovascularization, enhanced total retinal score and retinal apoptotic cell number, degeneration of dopaminergic amacrine cells, increased glomerular PAS-positivity, altered excreted total protein/creatinine ratio and cold allodynia, parallel with medium scale hyperglycemia (blood glucose level between 22 and 25mmol/L) and satisfying state of health.

Discussion: We established a treatment protocol in rats enabling complex investigation of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy on a long-term period. Clearly hyperglycemic dependent parameters of these complications serve as good outcome measures for preclinical trials. Our results provide a useful basis for designing studies for testing preventative treatments as well as other translational medical research in this field.","In the present study we tried different insulin treatment protocols to keep diabetic rats in relatively good health but to allow different levels of hyperglycemia to remain for a long time. Prolonged release insulin implants (Havel et al., 2000) proved to be suitable for keeping targeted glycemic control. Furthermore, applying different doses of implants enabled different levels of hyperglycemia to be set, and thus allowed the investigation of pathological changes dependent on hyperglycemia. "
Diabetes insipidus in uricase-deficient mice: a model for evaluating therapy with poly(ethylene glycol)-modified uricase,"Uricase-deficient mice develop uric acid nephropathy, with high mortality rates before weaning. Urate excretion was quantitated and renal function was better defined in this study, to facilitate the use of these mice as a model for evaluating poly(ethylene glycol)-modified recombinant mammalian uricases (PEG-uricase) as a potential therapy for gout and uric acid nephropathy. The uric acid/creatinine ratio in the urine of uricase-deficient mice ranges from 10 to >30; on a weight basis, these mice excrete 20- to 40-fold more urate than do human subjects. These mice consistently develop a severe defect in renal concentrating ability, resulting in an approximately sixfold greater urine volume and a fivefold greater fluid requirement, compared with normal mice. This nephrogenic diabetes insipidus leads to dehydration and death of nursing mice but, with adequate water replacement, high urine flow protects adults from progressive renal damage. Treatment of uricase-deficient mice with PEG-uricase markedly reduced urate levels and, when initiated before weaning, preserved the renal architecture (as evaluated by magnetic resonance micros-copy) and prevented the loss of renal concentrating function. PEG-uricase was far more effective and less immunogenic than unmodified uricase. Retention of uricase in most mammals and its loss in humans and some other primates may reflect the evolution of renal function under different environmental conditions. PEG-uricase could provide an effective therapy for uric acid nephropathy and refractory gout in human patients.","We have observed that mice that lack uricase develop a severe, persistent, renal concentrating defect that results from renal damage induced by excretion of uric acid in amounts that exceed its solubility in urine. The magnitude of uric acid overexcretion is remarkable. The uric acid/creatinine ratio in urine was >30 in young mice and approximately 10 in adults. By comparison, urinary uric acid/creatinine ratios of 3 to 5 have been observed in children with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency, and uric acid/creatinine ratios of >1 have been associated with acute uric acid nephropathy in human patients (35,36). In comparison with body weight, we estimate that uricase-deficient mice excrete 20- to 40-fold more uric acid/d than do human subjects.

The DI of uricase-deficient mice resembles the persistent concentrating defect in Gunn rats, which lack hepatic glucuronyl transferase; the defect was reversible if unconjugated bilirubinemia was corrected in young animals, before permanent structural renal damage occurred (37). The DI is also related mechanistically to the transient DI that may follow renal tubular injury caused by ischemia, toxins, or obstruction (e.g., postobstructive diuresis). This transient DI might be a manifestation of injury or of the recovery of tubular epithelium. It can result in severe volume depletion, but it may also serve a protective function, i.e., to reduce the concentration of an offending toxin or obstructing agent. The persistent DI of uricase-deficient mice may be lethal in nursing animals but essential for the survival of adults.

Structural kidney damage and DI are evident in Uox-/- mice by 2 wk of age, when mortality (26) and uric acid excretion (Figure 1) are highest. Adult Uox-/- mice with severe DI exhibited little evidence of progressive renal insufficiency, and many exhibited normal lifespans. However, before our recognition of their fivefold greater water requirement, some died as a result of dehydration after exhausting water supplies adequate for normal mice. The high mortality rate before weaning is probably attributable to the inadequacy of maternal milk as the only source of fluid replacement. Death resulting from dehydration was similarly attributed to polyuria in nursing mice in which the gene for the NaK2Cl cotransporter had been disrupted (38). However, after weaning, a sixfold elevated urine volume, compensated by adequate water intake, may limit further deposition of uric acid in renal tubules, preventing progressive renal failure. Such a protective role for nephrogenic DI is consistent with the finding that high tubular fluid flow attributable to inherited pituitary DI prevented acute uric acid nephropathy in a rat model in which the serum urate concentration was increased to 20 mg/dl by the infusion of both urate and oxonic acid (an inhibitor of uricase) (39). Maintenance of high urine volume is used clinically to treat uric acid renal stones and acute uric acid nephropathy in human patients (5,6).

Relevance to Evolution
Discussions of uricase evolution have often speculated on advantages derived from loss of the enzyme, such as increased longevity resulting from the radical-scavenging ability of urate (3). A less anthropocentric view might consider the benefit of uricase to other species for which renal water conservation has been an essential adaptation to seasonal drought or arid climates. The avoidance of uric acid precipitation in maximally concentrated urine would strongly favor the retention of uricase; its loss might lead to lethal nephropathy, as in uricase-knockout mice. In contrast, ancestors of New World monkeys, hominoid apes, and humans, in which Uox gene mutations became fixed (2), may have lived in rain forests. With abundant water, maintenance of relatively dilute urine may have been better tolerated and favored as an adaptation to environmental toxins, as well as to the loss of uricase. Other protective mechanisms might have been in place or selected subsequently, e.g., efficient proximal tubular reabsorption to limit the access of uric acid to collecting ducts, where maximal concentration and acidification occur, or shorter renal papillae to limit distal water reabsorption. The reduced ability of the neonatal kidney to concentrate and acidify urine may protect human infants from uric acid nephropathy at a time when urate clearance is considerably higher than that in adults (40).

PEG-Uricase as a Potential Therapy for Refractory Gout
Fungal and pig liver uricases, PEGylated in various ways, have been studied in uricase-expressing animals (41,42,43). Where reduced immunogenicity has been achieved, it has been at levels of PEG coupling that cause substantial loss of catalytic activity. PEGylated Candida and Arthrobacter uricases were demonstrated to decrease serum urate concentrations in a few patients with malignancies, but neither preparation was subsequently produced for clinical trials (44,45).

We have taken several steps aimed at producing a PEGuricase more suitable for long-term therapy. (1) We chose porcine uricase, which has >85% identity with the deduced amino acid sequence of human uricase, rather than a microbial enzyme with <40% identity or baboon uricase, which has slightly greater sequence similarity but is much less active. We considered “reactivating” human uricase by eliminating both known nonsense mutations but concluded that it would be difficult to identify and “correct” any missense mutations acquired during evolution. (2) Addition of potential PEG attachment sites (lysine residues) enhanced the ability of PEGylation to reduce the immunogenicity of a bacterial enzyme in mice (32). This presumably resulted from better epitope masking. We applied this strategy to pig uricase by changing Arg-291 to lysine. The resulting PBC and related enzymes are fully active and possess one to four more lysines than other cloned mammalian uricases (mouse, rat, rabbit, and baboon uricases). (3) We optimized PEGylation to achieve a PEG-uricase that retains the activity of the native enzyme but is substantially more soluble at physiologic pH and is much less immunogenic in mice.

Because of their extraordinary excretion of uric acid and the resulting renal damage, Uox—/— mice provide an excellent model for testing efficacy. Injections of PEG-uricase at 5- to 7-d intervals controlled hyperuricemia and markedly reduced urate excretion in uricase-knockout mice and, when initiated before weaning, prevented the development of nephropathy. This treatment elicited minimal antibody response. In contrast to PEG-uricase, unmodified recombinant mammalian uricase was ineffective in decreasing uric acid levels and was highly immunogenic. These results suggest that this form of PEG-uricase could be effective in treating both acute and chronic hyperuricemia and uricosuria. In addition to use in the acute setting of chemotherapy for malignancies, PEG-uricase could provide a much-needed therapy for controlling chronic hyperuricemia in patients with inherited metabolic disorders and in patients with severe gout who are allergic or unresponsive to conventional therapy.

A modelling study of the budget impact of improved glycaemic control in adults with Type 1 diabetes in the UK,"Aims: To develop a novel interactive budget impact model that assesses affordability of diabetes treatments in specific populations, and to test the model in a hypothetical scenario by estimating cost savings resulting from reduction in HbA1c from ≥69 mmol/mol (8.5%) to a target of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) in adults with Type 1 diabetes in the UK.

Methods: A dynamic, interactive model was created using the projected incidence and progression over a 5-year horizon of diabetes-related complications (micro- and macrovascular disease, severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis) for different HbA1c levels, with flexible input of population size, complications and therapy costs, HbA1c distribution and other variables. The model took a National Health Service and societal perspective.

Results: The model was developed, and in the proposed hypothetical situation, reductions in complications and expected costs evaluated. Achievement of target HbA1c in individuals with HbA1c ≥69 mmol/mol (8.5%) would reduce expected chronic complications from 6.8 to 1.2 events per 100 person-years, and diabetic ketoacidosis from 14.5 to 1.0 events per 100 person-years. Potential cumulative direct cost savings achievable in the modelled population were estimated at £687 m over 5 years (£5,585/person), with total (direct and indirect) savings of £1,034 m (£8,400/person).

Conclusions: Implementation of strategies aimed at achieving target glucose levels in people with Type 1 diabetes in the UK has the potential to drive a significant reduction in complication costs. This estimate may provide insights into the potential for investment in achieving savings through improved diabetes care in the UK.

"Metformin, sitagliptin, and liraglutide modulate serum retinol-binding protein-4 level and adipocytokine production in type 2 diabetes mellitus rat model","Many adipocytokines correlate with obesity and insulin resistance. We examined the effects of metformin, sitagliptin, and liraglutide in diabetic rats. Group 1: control normal (CN) rats received oral saline daily. Group 2: diabetic non-treated (DNT) rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to get diabetic then after 72 h received oral saline daily. Group 3: rats were injected with STZ then after 72 h were treated with metformin (200 mg/kg) orally. Group 4: rats were injected with STZ then after 72 h received sitagliptin 6 mg/kg orally twice daily. Group 5: rats were injected with STZ then after 72 h were treated with liraglutide at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg every 12 h subcutaneous injection. After 8 weeks, body mass, fasting blood glucose, adipocytokines, and lipid profile were assessed. From the results, we concluded that the 3 drugs improved blood glucose and insulin resistance with correction of adipocytokines serum levels; however, the liraglutide-treated group was the only group that showed significant body mass reduction.",
Construction and Verification of Predictive Model for Influencing Factors of Quality of Life in Patients with Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy: A Hospital-Based Retrospective Study,"Objective: The influencing factors of quality of life (QOL) in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) were explored, a practical risk prediction model was constructed and independent verification was conducted.

Methods: The clinical data of 273 patients with T2DN in Tai’an Maternal and Child Health Care Center from February 2021 to February 2023 were used for retrospective analysis, and the patients were divided into modelling group (n = 173) and validation group (n = 100). According to 36-item short form health survey (SF-36) scores, the research subjects in the modelling group were divided further into poor group (n = 78) and good group (n = 95). Multivariate logistic regression was used in analysing the influencing factors of QOL and establishing a clinical prediction model based on the results. Then, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used in evaluating the model’s prediction efficiency.

Results: Remarkable differences in age, duration of diabetes, presence or absence of hypertension, education level, exercise frequency and family monthly income were found among the patients (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested age ≥60 (odds ratio (OR) = 3.395, 95% CI = 1.269–9.083), duration of diabetes ≥3 years (OR = 4.574, 95% CI = 1.623–12.885), presence of hypertension (OR = 4.011, 95% CI = 1.490–10.796), education level of junior high school and below (OR = 7.318, 95% CI = 3.648–14.678), no or little exercise (OR = 3.948, 95% CI = 1.989–7.839) and family monthly income <3500 yuan (OR = 2.871, 95% CI = 1.089–7.573) are risk factors for poor QOL (p < 0.05). The regression model was logit (p) = –5.412 + 1.222X1 + 1.520X2 + 1.389X3 + 1.990X4 + 1.373X5 + 1.055X6 (X1 as age ≥60, X2 as duration of diabetes ≥3 years, X3 as presence of hypertension, X4 as education level of below junior high school, X5 as no or little exercise and X6 as family monthly income <3500 yuan). Based on this model, the ROC curve showed that the AUC value, standard error and 95% CI were 0.842, 0.043 and 0.758–0.926, respectively. An analysis was made on the re-included 100 patients, and the predictive sensitivity, specificity and Kappa coefficient of the constructed model were 82.10%, 86.90% and 0.703.","Conclusions: Age ≥60, duration of diabetes ≥3 years, presence of hypertension, education level of junior high school and below, no or little exercise and family monthly income <3500 yuan were independent influencing factors for poor QOL in patients with T2DN. The use of this model has certain clinical application value."
A strategy to enhance the usability of the minimal model as used with the intravenous glucose tolerance test in diabetes research and clinical management,"Abstract
The Minimal Model method of determining Insulin Sensitivity from the Intravenous glucose Tolerance Test is a valuable tool for the Diabetes research community. However the Minimal Model algorithm itself is not readily available in a user-friendly modern windows environment to the clinical researcher in many research departments. In addition use of the model often requires intervention by an experienced “modeller” to interpret the results produced by the method. This paper proposes a more readily available and usable version of the program and discusses the issues which surround the use of the program by clinical researchers without computer mathematical modelling experience.

Diabetes mellitus in the guinea pig,"Spontaneous diabetes mellitus has been documented in a colony of guinea pigs. The contagious nature of the disease has been verified, but the nature of the infectious agent is not known. Animals from the original colony or animals exposed to the colony with normal glucose tolerance tests (GTT) became diabetic, as evidenced by elevated one- and four-hour GTT values, and in most cases have significant glycosuria. The severity of pathologic changes in the pancreatic islets parallel, in general, the severity of the clinical symptoms (glycosuria and abnormal GTT). Those animals with severe glycosuria and elevated FBS as well as one- and four-hour GTT values had the most pronounced degranulation and most prominent cytoplasmic inclusions in islet B cells. The severity of scarring in the islets can be correlated with the duration of the overt diabetic state. The other clinical parameters of note were elevated serum triglycerides, normal serum but elevated aortic cholesterol, and absence of ketonemia or ketonuria. The reproductive capacity of diabetic females was compromised. While the clinical manifestations are mild or variable, the presence of significant islet pathology is reminiscent of human juvenile diabetes mellitus. These findings lend support to the concept that infectious and/or immune mechanisms could be operative in the etiology and pathogenesis of human diabetes mellitus.","The present report documents the existence of spontaneous diabetes mellitus in guinea pigs of contagious nature. The affected animals vary markedly in  clinical characteristics, and the clinical severity in  general parallels the severity of the pancreatic islet pathology. Since asymptomatic animals (no glycosuria, normal FBS, elevated GTT, and minimal islet pathology but severe renal glomerular changes)  have been encountered,8 caution must be exercised in  interpreting the presence or absence of glycosuria without considering the autopsy findings and GTT data. The use of the GTT index has provided a method of separating presumptive normal living animals from those with presumptive diabetes. The use of the GTT index permitted a comparison of other laboratory parameters of these two populations. In the 24 normal animals presented here (table 2) only sporadic elevations of the GTT index were encountered. These could have been laboratory errors. However, considering the extreme contagiousness of the syndrome, these could be transient expressions of a diabetic state and subsequent reversion to normalcy. Glycosuria, when marked, was a reliable predictor of an abnormal GTT and was usually associated with an elevated FBS and severe islet pathology. A comparison of animals 159 and 160 in table 1 is striking. Both of these animals were introduced into the colony at the same time. One week prior to autopsy 160 was severely glycosuric, had an elevated FBS, and at autopsy had a severe pancreatic lesion. Pig 159 was marginally (if at all) glycosuric, the FBS was normal, and the islet lesion only moderately severe. In addition, no. 160 became diabetic on the basis of glycosuria earlier than no. 159. Caution must be exercised in interpreting mild glycosuria, since ascorbic acid interferes with laboratory determinations for glycosuria.9 All guinea pigs require an exogenous source of ascorbic acid, which is rapidly excreted in the urine. For this reason, urinary glucose was arbitrarily considered abnormal only if it exceeded 100 mg. per 100 ml. In many of the diabetic guinea pigs, the urine contained more than 2,500 mg. of glucose per 100 ml. In some cases a mild glycosuria may have been real, since FBS and GTT values were abnormal (i.e., animals 37, 155, 158, 159)- In each of these instances the pancreatic islets evidenced only mild degranulation and the cytoplasmic inclusions were small, infrequent, and not present in all B cells. These findings resulted in a 1 or 2 + rating for islet pathology. The severity of scarring and fibrosis in the pancreatic islets can be correlated with the duration of the disease; thus, in animals diabetic for months, scarring was more severe than in those animals with overt diabetes for a period of a few weeks. The animals listed in table 1 are derived from the original colony (Source—Col) as well as animals purchased and introduced into the colony (Source—Perf). The earlier animals often were not subjected to serial GTT, but in all cases conversion to a diabetic state was evidenced by frank glycosuria, whereas previously urine sugars were normal. In those animals in which serial GTTs were performed and urine sugar data obtained (beyond no. 107), conversion to the diabetic state is more precisely documented. Table 1 illustrates a problem in interpreting and documenting this diabetic state in guinea pigs. The autopsy data provide the most reliable diagnostic criteria. A fasting blood sugar per se may be misleading, and cytologically normal B cells are present in islets with significant pathology; i.e., most B cells degranulated and contained large masses of inclusion. The islets in this circumstance presumably are capable of secreting sufficient insulin to maintain a normal FBS. A sugar load is frequently handled in an abnormal manner. The implication can be drawn that in this model we are observing the onset of a disease process. Equivalent cytopathologic data are not available from the human form of the disease for comparison. Less than 10 per cent of the diabetic guinea pigs have any evidence of ketonuria, and ketonemia has not been detected in any of them. Ketonuria, when present, is mild and transitory, and there does not appear to be any significant correlation to the severity of the disease and/or the level of blood sugar. The measurement of insulin levels would, of course, be helpful in assessing these phenomena. However, these comparisons have been impeded because of the lack of a suitable method for assaying guinea pig insulin. It may be hoped that current research on the development of a suitable technic will make this possible in the near future. It is generally known that serum cholesterol levels are significantly elevated in many human diabetics; however, the data on the lipid content of serum and tissues from these guinea pigs are similar to those previously reported in young human diabetics with vascular disease by Ahuja et al.10 Although serum triglyceride levels in these young patients showed a statistically significant increase, there was no increase in serum cholesterol levels. Atherosclerotic lesions have not been noted in our colony of guinea pigs, but this fact may be explained by the relatively young age of the animals examined and the relatively brief duration of the disease process studied in detail to date. The neonatal mortality in litters born to diabetic females is also similar to that among the offspring of diabetic human mothers. The observation that diabetic guinea pigs tend to have smaller litters suggests that they may also have a higher fetal mortality, with subsequent resorption of the dead fetuses. Other parameters commonly associated with diabetes mellitus in man are being studied in this colony of guinea pigs. Bilateral cataracts have developed in five of the older animals, but it is too early to tell whether this condition will occur in the others. The present study can say nothing as to the etiology of the disease. Because of its contagious nature, viruses might be suspect. However, at no time have any recognizable viral particles been seen in endocrine pancreatic cells or kidney, and both organs have been subject to intensive electron-microscopic study. Immune mechanisms may well be operative.11 Certainly the absence of necrosis and insulitis in the acute, overt, asymptomatic, as well as chronic disease in these animals would argue against a classic viral infection in pancreatic B cells. Diabetes mellitus in animals is known to occur in isolated cases.12 Rabb et al.13 described three tree shrews with hyperglycemia and glycosuria; these animals had lesions in the pancreatic islets consisting of vacuolization of the beta cells, with some fibrosis. The Chinese hamster presents a complicated picture with variable severity of the diabetic syndrome as described originally by Meier and Yerganian14 and more recently by Gerritsen and Blanks.15 The pathology is also variable, depending on the state of the diabetes.16""18 Scarring and fibrosis of the pancreatic islet vascular stroma is minimal in this diabetic syndrome. The obese-hyperglycemic mouse (ob/ob) is a welldocumented animal model of diabetes mellitus.1920 Several stages in the progression of the diabetic syndrome in obese mice have been demonstrated, including prominent hyperplasia of the pancreatic islets associated with hyperinsulinism.20 Recently, diabetic syndromes have seen described in a variety of other small rodents. One of these, the sand rat (Psammomys obesus), becomes diabetic when placed on a high-calorie diet.3 The ""Wellesley Hybrid"" mouse,21 yellow obese mouse,22 spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus),23 New Zealand obese (NZO) mouse,24 and the diabetic (KK) strain25 of mouse are all characterized by massive hyperplasia of pancreatic islets. Coleman and Hummel26 have described another diabetic strain of mice (db). Unfortunately, the mice in this diabetic (db) strain are infertile and appear to have a generalized dysfunction of the endocrine systems. None of these isolated cases in animal models are contagious in nature, and the islet pathology in none of the animal models resembles that of human or guinea pig models. The other mbdel of diabetes relevant to interpreting the disease state in guinea pigs is the welldocumented diabetic state as described by Craighead and coworkers2728 in mice following infection with encephalomyocarditis virus. This syndrome develops only in certain strains of mice (? genetic factors) and is the result of a real viral infection, with necrosis of B cells and inflammation in the islets. While the pathology of this model does not at all resemble that seen in the guinea pig, it is a diabetic state resulting from selective viral damage to islet B cells. The guinea pig model and the mouse model following EMC-virus infection would both support the concept that infectious and/or immune mechanisms may occur in the etiology and/or pathogenesis of human diabetes mellitus. Diabetic guinea pigs do not require an exogenous source of insulin for survival, and there is no evidence of total B cell destruction as in alloxan diabetes.2930 While this phenomenon is not clearly understood, it offers the advantage of permitting long-term study of the metabolic defect without therapeutic interference."
UKPDS58--modeling glucose exposure as a risk factor for photocoagulation in type 2 diabetes,"In type 2 diabetes, the risk of retinopathy, and of retinal photocoagulation, rises with time after diagnosis of diabetes. In this paper, mathematical modeling shows that this ageing effect is attributable to the rise in glycemia with time since diagnosis of diabetes. Mathematical models were fitted to data from 3648 patients from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). A proportional hazards model, in which time and glycemia measured by HbA1c are independent risk factors for photocoagulation, was compared to a model in which time does not contribute except through a measure of cumulative glucose exposure. Since likelihood ratio tests cannot be applied to non-nested models, graphical methods were used to compare the two models. The glucose exposure model was able to fit variation in survival with time at least as well as the proportional hazards model. The proportional hazards model, however, seriously underestimates the differences in two groups of different mean HbA1c. We conclude that duration of diabetes and HbA1c level better predict risk for photocoagulation when treated as two components of cumulative glucose exposure, than when treated as independent risk factors.","Previous studies have shown that the risk for retinal photocoagulation varies continuously with glycemia Klein et al., 1995, Nakagami et al., 1997, and increases with duration of diabetes (UKPDS Group, 1997). These results are confirmed by the likelihood ratio tests, in which both , are significant improvements on reference model (1). New here are direct comparisons between , , in the graphical results.

Influence of neighbourhood socioeconomic position on the transition to type II diabetes in older Mexican Americans: the Sacramento Area Longitudinal Study on Aging,"Objective
To examine the influence of neighbourhood socioeconomic position (NSEP) on development of diabetes over time.

Design
A longitudinal cohort study.

Setting
The data reported were from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging, a longitudinal study of the health of 1789 older Latinos.

Participants
Community-dwelling older Mexican Americans residing in the Sacramento Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Main outcome
Multistate Markov regression were used to model transitions through four possible states over time: 1=normal; 2=pre-diabetic; 3=diabetic; and 4=death without diabetes.

Results
At baseline, nearly 50% were non-diabetic, 17.5% were pre-diabetic and nearly 33% were diabetic. At the end of follow-up, there were a total of 824 people with type 2 diabetes. In a fully adjusted MSM regression model, among non-diabetics, higher NSEP was not associated with a transition to pre-diabetes. Among non-diabetics, higher NSEP was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (HR=1.66, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.42) and decreased risk of death without diabetes (HR: 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96). Among pre-diabetics, higher NSEP was significantly associated with a transition to non-diabetic status (HR: 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.50). Adjusting for BMI, age, education, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, medical insurance and nativity did not affect this relationship.

Conclusions
Our findings show that high NSEP poses higher risk of progression from normal to diabetes compared with a lower risk of death without diabetes. This work presents a possibility that these associations are modified by nativity or culture.
","We found that higher NSEP was associated with a greater likelihood to transition from normal to diabetes. However, higher NSEP was associated with a lower likelihood of transitioning to death without diabetes. Higher NSEP was associated with a greater likelihood that pre-diabetics would transition to normal status. All other transitions were not influenced by NSEP. We accounted for sociodemographic and health/behavioural variables in our adjustments. Adjustment for individual socioeconomic factors (education, income, occupation) did not substantially influence the association of census-level NSEP with the various transitions. The opposite effects of NSEP in normal participants of higher risk of incident diabetes and lower risk of death without diabetes may be explained by the negative influence of low SES and potentially beneficial higher concentrations of cultural protections represented by the HII.

Our findings may be due to unmeasured mediators such as behaviour and/or differential access to healthcare. As Latino immigrants become more acculturated they are more likely to have higher levels of education and income, but they also may be more likely to consume more alcohol, smoke and adapt unhealthy food choices associated with a more US diet.23 24 In other literature, higher levels of acculturation have been associated with higher rates of obesity and diabetes.25 Work by Kershaw et al7 about neighbourhood ethnic isolation suggested that prevalence of obesity was actually lower in Mexican American study participants living in a predominantly Hispanic neighbourhood. In this same study, obesity was lower in the foreign born, but estimates were not made for the influence of nativity on obesity in relation to ethnic isolation.

Consistent with our initial hypothesis and some other work,20 we did find that the transition from normal to non-diabetes death was associated with lower neighbourhood social position (NSEP), while the transition from pre-diabetes to no diabetes was associated with higher NSEP. Latinos with increased levels of education and income are more likely to have access to and use healthcare. Healthcare usage may increase medical screenings and treatment; all important factors in the prevention of death from any disease. For older Latinos, the usage of healthcare is key, as they are disparately at higher risk of diabetes and pre-diabetes compared with non-Latino whites.25 However, we adjusted for healthcare access with no effect. Access to care is more likely to affect progression of a condition than incidence, unless an intervention targets a risk factor such as obesity. We did not have measures of diet which is a limitation of the study.

The higher risk of developing diabetes associated with higher NSEP in our study of older Latinos was consistent with the Hispanic paradox.26 The protective effect of low NSEP on risk of death without diabetes in normal participants, specifically the decreased risk for transition from normal to death without diabetes, may also be consistent with the Hispanic paradox. The Hispanic paradox postulates that Latinos have better health outcomes despite a lower socioeconomic status than non-Latino whites. Criticisms of this view suggest that migrants are a healthier population than the US born. Work by Espinoza26 reports that the mortality difference in Mexican Americans versus European Americans is largely explained by adjustment for socioeconomic measures.26 We have some evidence that less acculturated Latinos are less likely to transition to diabetes. It may be that as Latinos in our study became more acculturated over time, they adopted more unhealthy behaviours. Along with the rest of the nation, Latinos will age and live longer. It is predicated that over the next 40 years Latinos over the age of 65 will double and those over the age of 85 will triple.25 27 If in the next four decades, Latinos become the largest ethnic minority in the USA, then understanding the roles that NSEP and cultural change play in the prevention of pre-diabetes and diabetes and its health-related costs and complications is vital.

Diabetes insipidus contributes to traumatic brain injury pathology via CD36 neuroinflammation,"Each year, over one million people in the United States are affected by traumatic brain injury (TBI). Symptoms of both acute and chronic neuroinflammation follow TBI, coinciding with a robust immune response and activation of the brain’s endogenous repair mechanisms. TBI can lead to endocrine failure as a result of damage to the thalamic region of the brain, evidenced by excessive thirst and polyuria often accompanying TBI. These symptoms indicate the presence of diabetes insipidus (DI), a disruption of water homeostasis due to antidiuretic hormone deficiency. This deficiency accompanies a mechanical or neuroinflammatory damage to the thalamic region during TBI, evidenced by increased expression of inflammatory microglial marker MHCII in this brain region. Excessive thirst and urinations, which are typical DI symptoms, in our chronic TBI rats also suggest a close connection between TBI and DI. We seek to bridge this gap between TBI and DI through investigation of the Cluster of Differentiation 36 (CD36) receptor. This receptor is associated with Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) deregulation, proinflammatory events, and innate immunity regulation. We posit that CD36 exacerbates TBI through immune activation and subsequent neuroinflammation. Indeed, scientific evidence already supports pathological interaction of CD36 in other neurological disorders including stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. We propose that DI contributes to TBI pathology via CD36 neuroinflammation. Use of CD36 as a biomarker may provide insights into treatment and disease pathology of TBI and DI. This unexplored avenue of research holds potential for a better understanding and treatment of TBI and DI.","Our recent laboratory observations revealed a rampant neuroinflammation in the thalamic region of the brain in our chronic TBI animals, as evidenced by the overexpression of the inflammatory microglial marker MHCII. With this new knowledge, we next assessed whether CD36 colocalized with the MHCII-stained thalamic cells. Interestingly, we found that CD36 expression was increased in the same thalamic area populated by the inflammatory MHCII cells (Figure 2). Equally compelling in support of our hypothesis is the demonstration that this histopathological detection of CD36-neuroinflammation in the thalamic region in our chronic TBI animals coincided with the observation that the majority of the rats displayed excessive thirst and urinations, which are routine CDI behavioral pathologic outcomes. What previously seemed like a usual side effect to TBI is actually a hallmark feature of CDI. These underexplored and novel brain pathological and behavioral symptoms of TBI advance our hypothesis linking TBI to the phenotypic characteristics of CDI.

Postoperative Copeptin Concentration Predicts Diabetes Insipidus After Pituitary Surgery,"Context: Copeptin is a stable surrogate marker of vasopressin release; the peptides are stoichiometrically secreted from the neurohypophysis due to elevated plasma osmolality or nonosmotic stress. We hypothesized that following stress from pituitary surgery, patients with neurohypophyseal damage and eventual diabetes insipidus (DI) would not exhibit the expected pronounced copeptin elevation.

Objective: The objective was to evaluate copeptin's accuracy to predict DI following pituitary surgery.

Design: This was a prospective multicenter observational cohort study.

Setting: Three Swiss or Canadian referral centers were used.

Patients: Consecutive pituitary surgery patients were included.

Measurements: Copeptin was measured postoperatively daily until discharge. Logistic regression models and diagnostic performance measures were calculated to assess relationships of postoperative copeptin levels and DI.

Results: Of 205 patients, 50 (24.4%) developed postoperative DI. Post-surgically, median [25th-75th percentile] copeptin levels were significantly lower in patients developing DI vs those not showing this complication: 2.9 [1.9-7.9] pmol/L vs 10.8 [5.2-30.4] pmol/L; P < .001. Logistic regression analysis revealed strong association between postoperative copeptin concentrations and DI even after considering known predisposing factors for DI: adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.41 (1.16-1.73). DI was seen in 22/27 patients with copeptin <2.5 pmol/L (positive predictive value, 81%; specificity, 97%), but only 1/40 with copeptin >30 pmol/L (negative predictive value, 95%; sensitivity, 94%) on postoperative day 1.

Limitations: Lack of standardized DI diagnostic criteria; postoperative blood samples for copeptin obtained during everyday care vs at fixed time points.

Conclusions: In patients undergoing pituitary procedures, low copeptin levels despite surgical stress reflect postoperative DI, whereas high levels virtually exclude it. Copeptin therefore may become a novel tool for early goal-directed management of postoperative DI.","To our knowledge, this is the first published study to evaluate the accuracy of copeptin, an AVP surrogate, to identify DI during recovery from pituitary surgery. Our main observation was that copeptin increased during surgery in patients with intact posterior pituitary function, so elevated initial postoperative copeptin levels strongly predicted a DI-free postoperative course. Conversely, low values despite surgical stress reliably discriminated postoperative DI, especially when copeptin was measured within 12 hours after surgery. Discriminative power of low postoperative copeptin levels was strongest in patients with early DI onset or persistent DI. Given the frequently sudden onset of postoperative water balance changes, an early, accurate predictive biomarker of postoperative DI, enabling prompt effective interventions to manage this complication, is of particular interest.

Our data broadly align with those of a prospective observational study in which AVP was measured in patients undergoing pituitary procedures (3). That study, involving 57 individuals, showed that AVP increases during surgery were blunted in patients with postsurgical DI. However, the difference in AVP kinetics did not reach statistical significance, likely due to major analytical problems with AVP and to small sample size.

In the nonpostoperative setting, copeptin was already evaluated in the differential diagnosis of persistent DI (26). Therefore, a single baseline copeptin determination less than 2.6 pmol/L could identify patients with complete central DI. However, to differentiate patients with partial central DI and primary polydipsia, an osmotic stimulus (water deprivation) was needed. Thus using an AVP/copeptin stimulus, eg, dehydration-induced hyperosmolality, could enhance copeptin's diagnostic accuracy. Likewise, a strong nonosmotic stressor such as hypoglycemia has been proposed to evaluate posterior pituitary function (18). Copeptin was measured in the context of an insulin tolerance test in a combined pituitary function assessment in patients 1 year after pituitary lesion resection. Patients with known DI had lower copeptin levels after stimulation compared with patients with intact posterior pituitary function. Although these data suggested that the insulin tolerance test provided helpful information regarding posterior pituitary function, such testing may be associated with severe hypoglycemia, and is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease or seizure history. Furthermore, such testing is inappropriate during immediate postoperative recovery. Indeed, our findings imply that pituitary surgery itself may be viewed as a standardized physiological stress test to assess functionality of AVP secretion.

In agreement with the literature (4, 12), our data revealed that known clinical risk factors for DI were more prevalent in patients with postoperative DI than in their counterparts without the complaint. Given that no clinical predisposing factor allows early identification of affected patients, copeptin measurement seems to offer a new option, especially considering that postoperative copeptin levels and DI remained significantly associated even after multivariate adjustment for known clinical risk factors.

Our study had limitations. For one, standardized diagnostic criteria for DI are lacking: the condition's hallmark, hypotonic polyuria, is nonspecific, and other clinical and biochemical indicia such as fluid balance, serum osmolality, and serum sodium usually do not change significantly in patients with intact thirst sensation and access to compensatory fluid intake (3). Therefore some DI diagnoses, especially in cases of transient partial DI, may have been missed in our study. However, postoperative DI incidence in our sample, 24.4%, was well within the published 16–34% range (4, 5, 27). In addition, our prospective study design, including careful DI diagnostic adjudication after comprehensive chart review including 3-month follow-up data, likely resulted in high sensitivity and specificity of DI diagnosis in our cohort.

A second study limitation was lack of standardization, eg, fixed time points, of blood withdrawals for copeptin measurement, attributable to lack of dedicated sampling for that purpose in this largely self-funded study. Although maximal stress is experienced shortly after extubation (23), sampling for our initial postoperative copeptin determination was performed a mean (SD), 6.7 (10.5) hours postsurgery rather than at a consistent postextubation time. By the sampling time, copeptin levels already might have normalized in patients with “late” measurement and uneventful postoperative course. However, absence of standardized sampling for copeptin measurement at a defined early timepoint presumably decreased copeptin accuracy in this study, rendering our findings conservative.

In conclusion, our data showed that in patients recovering from pituitary procedures, an early postoperative value of the AVP surrogate copeptin less than 2.5 pmol/L despite surgical stress accurately identifies postoperative DI. Conversely, copeptin concentration greater than 30 pmol/L within the same time frame accurately rules out this complication. These findings suggest that copeptin represents a new, early, and reliable single marker for postoperative DI in the postpituitary surgery setting, where no such marker currently is known. Postoperative copeptin measurements seem to provide important information for risk stratification and may identify patients benefitting from closer inpatient observation and patients in whom safe hospital discharge is possible."
Risk Modeling to Reduce Monitoring of an Autoantibody-Positive Population to Prevent DKA at Type 1 Diabetes Diagnosis,"Context: The presence of islet autoimmunity identifies individuals likely to progress to clinical type 1 diabetes (T1D). In clinical research studies, autoantibody screening followed by regular metabolic monitoring every 6 months reduces incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis.

Objective: We hypothesized that DKA reduction can be achieved on a population basis with a reduced frequency of metabolic monitoring visits. We reasoned that prolonged time between the development of T1D and the time of clinical diagnosis (""undiagnosed time"") would more commonly result in DKA and thus that limiting undiagnosed time would decrease DKA.

Methods: An analysis was conducted of data from TrialNet's Pathway to Prevention (PTP), a cross-sectional longitudinal study that identifies and follows at-risk relatives of people with T1D. PTP is a population-based study enrolling across multiple countries. A total of 6193 autoantibody (AAB)-positive individuals participated in PTP from March 2004 to April 2019. We developed models of progression to clinical diagnosis for pediatric and adult populations with single or multiple AAB, and summarized results using estimated hazard rate. An optimal monitoring visit schedule was determined for each model to achieve a minimum average level of undiagnosed time for each population.

Results: Halving the number of monitoring visits usually conducted in research studies is likely to substantially lower the population incidence of DKA at diagnosis of T1D.

Conclusion: Our study has clinical implications for the metabolic monitoring of at-risk individuals. Fewer monitoring visits would reduce the clinical burden, suggesting a path toward transitioning monitoring beyond the research setting.","Decades of research studies in multiple countries have firmly established that individuals with multiple AABs are expected to progress to clinical T1D. Furthermore, these studies consistently demonstrate that AAB screening in conjunction with regular glucose tolerance monitoring can markedly reduce the incidence of DKA at clinical diagnosis, as most individuals are identified via glucose tolerance testing when they have few if any symptoms of hyperglycemia (8). Monitoring visits in these studies almost always occur every 6 months. Translating this reduction in DKA to a clinical practice setting raises the question as to whether a different monitoring schedule can also achieve DKA reduction in an AAB+ population, with concomitant reduction in burden on AAB+ individuals and their providers.

To address this question, we considered a framework whereby the goal was to minimize the average amount of undiagnosed time for the AAB+ population, reasoning that prolonged time between the development of diabetes and when it is clinician-recognized would associate with increased incidence of DKA. This reasoning is supported by a recent report from The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study illustrating that DKA primarily occurred in those who did not attend routine monitoring visits on schedule (31). Using data from TrialNet's PTP study, we modeled diagnosis of disease across ages 1 to 50, and from this model characterized pediatric and adult populations with single or multiple AABs over an 18-year period for each group. Recognizing a clear trade-off between the number of visits and the amount of undiagnosed time, we determined an optimized visit schedule for each cohort that would limit the average undiagnosed time to not more than 6 months, though the algorithm can also be used to target other levels of average undiagnosed time. As an extreme example, selecting an average of 18 months of undiagnosed time in the pediatric multiple AAB+ population would require only 5 visits during a monitoring period from age 1 to 18 years. Here, we targeted a 6-month average undiagnosed time to mimic the schedule of twice-yearly visits commonly used in research studies that have demonstrated dramatic reductions in DKA at diagnosis. As illustrated, this level of undiagnosed time can be achieved with only 17 or 18 visits across 17 years in the single AAB+ pediatric or adult cohorts, respectively, and with 14 or 17 visits in the same age populations but with multiple AABs. This analysis implies that conducting approximately half the number of visits (14-18 visits for our schedule vs 34 for research studies) and using modified visit placement over a 17-year monitoring period is likely to be effective in substantially reducing the incidence of DKA to the levels seen in research studies both for children and adults. Adding HLA information has only a small effect on the placement and number of visits, for single or multiple AAB+ pediatric or adult cohorts. Of note, we evaluated only the effect of HLA DR3 or DR4; if other HLA risk groups were modeled, other variations in visit schedules may occur. This result is consistent with multiple reports that HLA primarily influences the development of autoimmunity and not progression from autoimmunity to diabetes (32–35).

While the model provides some confidence that an optimized schedule would reduce DKA if applied within the identified population, testing of the model in other data sets would provide additional support, particularly since the TrialNet PTP study includes only relatives of those with T1D. However, since the rate of progression of multiple antibody positivity in other studies that identify individuals either through screening those with selected HLA risk alleles (33) or via true population screening at young ages (2) does not appear to be different from those who were screened because they were relatives, we expect that an optimized schedule of those who are not relatives would be similar. If applied in “real-world” clinical practice, the incidence of DKA should be carefully tracked to confirm the utility of the monitoring schedules, including the possibility that even less frequent testing would be similarly effective. It is important to note that this analysis used TrialNet data, in which study visits include symptom awareness and education as well as metabolic testing. It is not clear which of these factors influences the reduction of DKA seen in research studies; here we address only the monitoring visit schedule and not the components of monitoring.

This work aimed to optimize monitoring visit schedules to reduce the incidence of DKA in the overall population from that seen under the existing standard of care, which currently does not incorporate either AAB screening or monitoring. As in follow-up monitoring in current research studies, such an approach will not eliminate all DKA, rather the model should improve overall outcomes for the population. Our approach places monitoring visits where progression events are most likely to happen in a population. This occurs both when risk is high and when a considerable proportion of the population is at risk. As a result, a schedule that limits the population average undiagnosed time will shift monitoring visits away from ages at which a lower number of patients progress. In a high-risk population this could mean that, for the small fraction remaining diagnosis free at older ages, monitoring could be less frequent.

In contrast to the population approach evaluated here, another approach under development is more personalized, whereby an AAB+ individual's parameters are used to determine their individual time-dependent risk of progression to T1D. This is akin to work conducted in peanut allergy, where prognostic biomarkers are used to model probabilities of clinical outcomes (eg, severe reactions to peanut), which a clinician can then use to personalize risk mitigation and patient care strategies (36). This approach is sensitive to an individual's risk at a given time and therefore may be more appealing to an individual and their clinicians but may create challenges for health care systems induced by a more complex treatment algorithm.

Screening for AABs followed by monitoring for disease progression in the context of research studies can reduce incidence of DKA at the time of T1D diagnosis. Yet development of clinical practice guidelines must also consider financial and operational components of implementing a screening and monitoring program within health care systems, minimizing the burdens while maintaining the potential benefits (37–39). Having introduced the concept of undiagnosed time as a key variable contributing to DKA, our work suggests optimal visit schedules for monitoring of the defined AAB+ populations that, even if slightly simplified for feasibility (e.g., 4 years rather than 4.1 years), should reduce the incidence of DKA at diagnosis if applied in clinical practice. Since the highest incidence of disease occurs in younger individuals, the frequency of visits of younger patients is increased and that of older individuals is consequently reduced to achieve a targeted population-based average undiagnosed time. This population-based approach can inform insurers and policy makers aiming to develop and implement clinical practice guidelines both to identify and monitor individuals at risk for T1D. Reducing the number of monitoring visits while still achieving clinically important reductions in DKA incidence decreases the burden on individuals and health care systems while sustaining the potential benefits, thus enhancing the rationale to implement screening and monitoring for T1D risk in clinical practice."
An alternative approach to modelling HbA1c trajectories in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Aims
Time-dependent HbA1c trajectories in health economic models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are typically informed by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). However, this approach may not accurately predict HbA1c progression in patients who do not conform to the demographic profile of the original UKPDS cohort. This study aimed to develop an alternative mathematical model (MM) to simulate HbA1c progression in T2DM.

Materials and methods
A systematic literature review identified studies, published between 2005 and 2015, that reported HbA1c in adult T2DM patients over a minimum duration of 18 months. Pooled data from eligible studies were used to develop an alternative MM equation for HbA1c progression, which was then contrasted with the UKPDS 68 progression equation in illustrative scenarios.

Results
A total of 68 studies were eligible for data extraction (mean follow-up time 4.1 years). HbA1c progression was highly heterogeneous across studies, varying with baseline HbA1c, treatment group and patient age. The MM equation was fitted with parameters for mean baseline HbA1c (8.3%), initial change in HbA1c (−0.62%) and upper quartile of maximum observed HbA1c (9.3%). Differences in HbA1c trajectories between the MM and UKPDS approaches altered the timing of therapy escalation in illustrative scenarios.","The MM represents an alternative approach to simulate HbA1c trajectories in T2DM models, as UKPDS data may not adequately reflect the heterogeneity of HbA1c profiles observed in clinical studies. However, the choice of approach should ultimately be determined by the characteristics of individual patients under consideration and the clinical face validity of the modelled trajectories."
Clinically relevant experimental rodent models of diabetic foot ulcer,"Chronic wounds are a substantial clinical problem in diabetes and nearly 6% of diabetics suffer from foot disease including ulceration, infection, and tissue necrosis. Wound healing in diabetes is impaired and delayed and is augmented by diabetic complications. Wound healing involves complex cellular, molecular, and biochemical processes and animal models are the most suitable prototype to investigate and understand the underlying pathological changes in the process of wound healing. Animal models are also useful in evaluating the safety and efficacy of newer therapeutic agents and improving the clinical approaches for human patients with chronic ulcers. The wound healing strategies get more complicated in the presence of diabetes and its associated complication. Despite the advancement in methods of wound healing, the healing of the chronic diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) remains an important clinical problem resulting in costly and prolonged treatment and poses a risk for major amputation. Saying that it is important to elucidate the newer therapeutic targets and strategies via an in-depth understanding of the complicated cascade of the chronic DFU. A major challenge in translating lab findings to clinics is the lack of an optimal preclinical model capable of properly recapitulating human wounds. Both small and large animal models of wound healing involving rodents, rabbits, and pigs have been discussed. Mouse and rats as small animal models and pig as large animal models have been discussed in association with the diabetic wound but there are advantages and limitations for each model. In this review, we critically reviewed the pros and cons of experimental models of diabetic wound healing with a focus on type II diabetes rodent models.","Animal models provide indispensable insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms as well as serve a career to test therapeutic agents. Rodent models are the most used animal models for diabetic wound healing. Among mice and rats, due to large size, ease of training, low cost, and larger surface area to induce wound rats appear to be the preferred animal model. This is also supported by the skin anatomy and longer time for wound healing in rats. Further, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance with hyperglycemia in ZDSD rat, the features also present in patients with diabetes, makes these rats a suitable model to study diabetic ulcers. Rat models help to evaluate therapeutic agents as well as in the in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of the impaired wound healing that will help to improve clinical outcomes in chronic diabetic foot ulcers."
The Prime Diabetes Model: Novel Methods for Estimating Long-Term Clinical and Cost Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,"Recent publications describing long-term follow-up from landmark trials and diabetes registries represent an opportunity to revisit modeling options in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
Objectives
To develop a new product-independent model capable of predicting long-term clinical and cost outcomes.
Methods
After a systematic literature review to identify clinical trial and registry data, a model was developed (the PRIME Diabetes Model) to simulate T1DM progression and complication onset. The model runs as a patient-level simulation, making use of covariance matrices for cohort generation and risk factor progression, and simulating myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, heart failure, nephropathy, retinopathy, macular edema, neuropathy, amputation, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, mortality, and risk factor evolution. Several approaches novel to T1DM modeling were used, including patient characteristics and risk factor covariance, a glycated hemoglobin progression model derived from patient-level data, and model averaging approaches to evaluate complication risk.
Results
Validation analyses comparing modeled outcomes with published studies demonstrated that the PRIME Diabetes Model projects long-term patient outcomes consistent with those reported for a number of long-term studies. Macrovascular end points were reliably reproduced across five different populations and microvascular complication risk was accurately predicted on the basis of comparisons with landmark studies and published registry data.
Conclusions
The PRIME Diabetes Model is product-independent, available online, and has been developed in line with good practice guidelines. Validation has indicated that outcomes from long-term studies can be reliably reproduced. The model offers new approaches to long-standing challenges in diabetes modeling and may become a valuable tool for informing health care policy.","The PRIME Diabetes Model has been developed on the basis of a systematic review of the literature on T1DM and its complications. The model has been developed in line with the Modeling Good Research Practices from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, including the conceptualization phase (incorporating input from external clinical and modeling experts), the development phase (incorporating best practices for individual-level state-transition models), as well as internal and external validation [[14]]. The model incorporates controllers for nine complications of T1DM, three treatment-related adverse events (ketoacidosis, nonsevere and severe hypoglycemia), and competing mortality. The risk of complication onset is informed exclusively by data taken from populations with T1DM, which may be unique among health economic models of the disease, with recent data used when available and appropriate, including several publications from 2014 and 2015. Model transparency and validation of results are crucial in the acceptance and uptake of any new model. The PRIME Diabetes Model code has been both audited by a third-party and validated against studies used in the development of the model and, when available, studies that did not inform model development (external validation). Validation results have been encouraging, with all simulations producing outcomes with annualized AUC differences of less than 1% when compared with published data.
Through the use of techniques novel to diabetes modeling, efforts have been made to make the model as representative and accurate as possible across a range of settings and populations. For example, studies have shown that prediction of CVD risk in populations with T1DM is population-specific [[15]]. CVD risk estimation in the PRIME Diabetes Model is based on a model averaging approach weighted by mean cohort characteristics. An analogous approach has been used in other modeling fields [[16]], and its application in the PRIME Diabetes Model has recently been published. In other areas, where two data sources were available or end-point definition was not clear, multimodels were incorporated such that uncertainty about disease progression and model structure could be accounted for. The PRIME Diabetes Model is also set apart from other models of T1DM, being a patient-level simulation and incorporating covariance of baseline patient characteristics and risk factor progression. The influence of covariance on model outcomes is an ongoing area of interest, and initial evaluations have suggested that although the impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios is limited, it does influence patient survival [[17]]. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that covariance may have a more substantial role in model discrimination when compared with calibration.
The PRIME Diabetes Model was designed as a health economic model and is primarily aimed at informing the decisions of health technology assessment groups, health care payers, and health care providers. In this context, it may also interest associated medical and insurance companies and academia. A number of novel features and positive validation data make the PRIME Diabetes Model an attractive option for modeling studies. Like all models, however, it has limitations. Although the risk of complication onset is taken solely from publications specific to T1DM, certain outcomes such as mortality associated with hypoglycemia are taken from populations with diabetes (mixed T1DM and T2DM). The model is only as accurate and transferable across populations as the data that inform it. As demonstrated for CVD, transferability of risk estimates between T1DM populations in different settings is not always accurate [[15]].
For certain complications, no data were available for external validation, meaning that complication risk had been validated only internally against source data. Source data were also taken from the published literature, and were generally available as mean cohort characteristics, with or without a measure of variance. These cohort summary statistics were used to produce a cohort of individual patients within the model that shared the same mean characteristics. Whether the model population truly reflected that underlying the source data is unknown. Furthermore, given that the PRIME Diabetes Model captures a large number of risk factors, not all risk factors were always available in the source data and were, in these cases, derived from other publications in T1DM. In general, patient-level simulation is seen as a benefit in health economic modeling [[18]]. Its implementation, however, can preclude the use of common modeling software such as Microsoft Excel and TreeAge (TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA) for more complex diseases, which are recommended by reimbursement authorities in some countries. The model is coded in Java, which is a comparatively fast and flexible language that facilitates simulations on a cohort of 1,000,000 patients, with PSA, within 18 minutes (or <2 minutes without PSA).
The PRIME Diabetes Model is a validated and externally audited patient-level, discrete event simulation model for populations with T1DM. The model is product-independent, available online, and has been developed in line with good practice guidelines. It has been developed using recent data specific to populations with T1DM and validation has indicated that outcomes from long-term T1DM studies can be reliably reproduced. The model offers new approaches to long-standing challenges in diabetes modeling and may become a valuable tool for informing health care policy in T1DM."
"A Mathematical Model of the Pathogenesis, Prevention, and Reversal of Type 2 Diabetes","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is generally thought to result from the combination of 2 metabolic defects, insulin resistance, which increases the level of insulin required to maintain glucose within the normal range, and failure of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells to compensate for the increased demand. We build on a mathematical model pioneered by Topp and colleagues to elucidate how compensation succeeds or fails. Their model added a layer of slow negative feedback to the classic insulin-glucose loop in the form of a slow, glucose-dependent birth and death law governing β-cell mass. We add to that model regulation of 2 aspects of β-cell function on intermediate time scales. The model quantifies the relative contributions of insulin action and insulin secretion defects to T2D and explains why prevention is easier than cure. The latter is a consequence of a threshold separating the normoglycemic and diabetic states (bistability), which also underlies the success of bariatric surgery and acute caloric restriction in rapidly reversing T2D. The threshold concept gives new insight into ""Starling's Law of the Pancreas,"" whereby insulin secretion is higher for prediabetics and early diabetics than for normal individuals.",
Development of a predictive model for symptomatic neuropathy in diabetes,"In evaluating therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing diabetic neuropathy, choosing a suitable measure of neural function is difficult, partly because the relation between most available objective measures and the development of symptomatic neuropathy (SN) is unclear. Using data from 67 diabetic patients, we developed a linear logistic regression model to assess the relationship between SN and a set of neural measures, including dark-adapted pupil size; pupillary latency; heart rate; a measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (R); the Valsalva ratio; and conduction velocities for the peroneal, median motor, and median sensory nerves. Models allowed for possible effects related to age, sex, duration and type of diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin, and adiposity. Thirty-two of the patients reported SN (autonomic and/or sensorimotor). The best-fitting model for predicting the presence of any SN included only heart rate, duration of disease, and R. Exclusion of duration (P < .01), or heart rate (P < .05), or R (P < .001) significantly impaired the fit of the model. To evaluate the temporally predictive power of the model, nine of the asymptomatic patients were reinterviewed 2 yr later by the same interviewer, who was unaware of the results of the modeling. Four of five to whom the model had assigned high probability of symptoms had indeed developed SN during the followup period, whereas none of the four assigned low probability had developed SN (P < .05). Thus it seems that a measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia provides an index of neural function strongly related to SN, and our follow-up data suggest that diminished R can be used to predict the development of SN in diabetes. DIABETES 1986; 35:873-80.","Several of the neurologic indices considered had previously been shown to discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic diabetic patients. ""Objective signs"" of neuropathy have been found20 to correlate well with abnormal responses to the Valsalva maneuver among diabetic patients. A decline in the response with duration of diabetes was also observed. Clarke et al.21 reported similar results. These reports are consistent with our finding that the Valsalva ratio entered significantly in an unadjusted model. But once adjustment was made for duration of disease and for heart rate, with which it is correlated, the Valsalva ratio offered no significant improvement in fit to the symptom data. Friedman et al.22 found longer pupillary latencies in diabetic patients with moderate to severe neuropathy of the extremities than in normal controls. Diabetic patients with little or no neuropathy were not significantly different from controls. Smith and Smith23 studied insulin-treated diabetic subjects and found that autonomic neuropathy was common among patients with abnormally small dark-adapted pupil size. Heart rate variability measured over a short time interval can be presumed to primarily reflect respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Wheeler and Watkins24 found reduced heart rate variability in patients with SN, as compared with healthy controls, and stated that diabetic patients without symptoms were similar to the controls. Page and Watkins25 found that when normal subjects, diabetic patients without neuropathy, diabetic patients with peripheral but not autonomic neuropathy, and diabetic patients with symptomatic autonomic neuropathy were compared, a progressive diminution from group to group was observed, with the most pronounced abnormality seen in the diabetic patients with autonomic symptoms. This general pattern was confirmed in a larger series of patients by Watkins and Mackay26 and by Mackay et al.8 These findings are further supported by the relative magnitudes of the R coefficients shown in Table 2. Hilsted and Jensen27 also found reduced heart rate variability associated with both peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Their classification of peripheral neuropathy was different from ours, however, in that theirs was test based and not subjective. Sundkvist et al.28 found reduced heart rate variability in diabetic patients with sensory neuropathy (and no symptoms of autonomic neuropathy) when compared with diabetic patients without neuropathy. Smith29 found that patients with symptomatic autonomic neuropathy were highly likely to have measurably diminished respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Thus, whereas a number of investigators have found differences in respiratory sinus arrhythmia between symptomatic and asymptomatic diabetic patients, none of these studies adequately adjusted for readily available clinical covariates such as duration of diabetes and heart rate in their analyses. In addition, Mackay30 found that the respiratory rate at which the respiratory sinus arrhythmia was maximal was slower in diabetic patients with neuropathy than in normal controls and suggested that the breathing rate at which heart rate variation is maximal may be a sensitive measure of neuropathy. This is a most intriguing finding, but we did not attempt to measure this optimizing rate and suspect that it would be difficult to do so routinely. A methodologic issue related to the logistic regression modeling we have employed should be addressed. Patients with SN are likely to be overrepresented in any clinic-based sample. One consequence of this is that the proportions derivable from the fitted models shown in Table 2 do not have direct literal meaning for the general population of diabetic patients. However, it has been shown mathematically19 that if these selection biases are unrelated to the predictor variables among those who already have symptoms and among those without symptoms, then the estimates of the coefficients in the linear logistic model are valid; bias toward symptomatic patients does not affect the estimates of coefficients of predictor variables or the assessment of statistical significance. This means that the tests for inclusion of predictors in the model are legitimate even in the presence of sampling bias (toward symptomatic diabetic patients), and the coefficients estimated have the usual interpretation as the natural logarithm of the odds ratio associated with a unit change in the predictor, with the other factors in the model held fixed. This explains why Fig. 2 shows the fitted odds-ratio curve rather than fitted prevalence of symptoms. Demonstrating its ability to discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic patients in a cross-sectional study is not enough to establish the prognostic utility of a neural index because the index might become abnormal only after symptoms have developed. Figure 1C illustrates that as neuropathy progresses, patients may move from 0 symptoms (toward the right) before moving upward in risk. Alternately, if the model is prognostic, they will tend to move upward in risk and then later develop symptoms. The figures seem most consistent with the latter because few symptomatic patients were assigned low-risk scores. The follow-up study described here, although limited in scale, does suggest that respiratory sinus arrhythmia may begin to decline before the onset of symptoms, and thus an index such as R may be sensitive enough to identify presymptomatic neural dysfunction. Mackay et al.8 measured respiratory sinus arrhythmia repeatedly over time in a series of patients followed for up to 5 yr. In their sample, 10 patients were judged abnormal initially, but only one of these developed autonomic symptoms during the follow-up period. In contrast, 3 of the 4 we followed who initially showed diminished respiratory sinus arrhythmia developed autonomic neuropathy during the follow-up period. Our sample is small, and this difference could certainly be due to sampling variability. Alternatively it could be due to the different measurement technique we used to assess respiratory sinus arrhythmia. The finding that R is a better predictor than standard deviation in these logistic models is not surprising in light of the fact that it is less affected than is standard deviation by nonrespiratory sources of variability, as previously discussed.14 The finding that respiratory sinus arrhythmia is reduced by propranolol in diabetic subject contrasts with previous evidence1524'31 that respiratory sinus arrhythmia is unaffected by propranolol in normal subjects. Vagal and sympathetic activities are known to alternate rhythmically with respiration in animals,3233 and it may be that sympathetic activity plays a greater role in respiratory sinus arrhythmia in diabetic than in normal subjects. If so, use of propranolol may provide a measure that is better able to distinguish diabetic from normal subjects and that is more specific for pa_r_asympathetic impairment. This may partially explain why R with propranolol was better able to predict autonomic neuropathy than R without propranolol. The six patients in our series whose only neuropathy was autonomic showed a pronounced reduction in R with propranolol. We found an increase in heart rate (9 beats/min) in symptomatic patients that could not be explained by differences in duration of disease. An association between objectively defined diabetic neuropathy and elevated resting heart rate has been noted by others.34 The natural history of changes in heart rate in diabetes is complicated. Initially a slight increase is seen, but with increasing duration of diabetes there is a slowing of heart rate, although rates tend to remain higher than in normal controls. These changes may reflect initial impairment of parasympathetic function followed by additional sympathetic impairment.3435 Because they are often present in patients without overt autonomic symptoms, these changes may prove prognostically predictive of SN. The possibility that some of the other indices studied (or not studied) may have prognostic value cannot be ruled out. The sample sizes for the nerve conduction velocities were smaller than for the other indices (—40 patients) and, although no trend toward coefficients different from 0 was found for this group of patients, the predictive utility of nerve DIABETES, VOL. 35, AUGUST 1986 879 Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article-pdf/35/8/873/354700/35-8-873.pdf by guest on 01 December 2023PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR SYMPTOMATIC NEUROPATHY conduction velocities might be demonstrable in a larger series of patients, especially if the measurement noise could be reduced by averaging over repetitions of the measurement. In summary, a retrospective review of neurologic data from 67 diabetic patients shows that a measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia corresponds well to subjectively symptomatic neuropathy. The results of a small follow-up study suggest that this index may diminish before the onset of symptoms and thus may be useful prognostically. The prognostic utility of measuring respiratory sinus arrhythmia can be best assessed by a prospective study beginning with a well-characterized cohort of asymptomatic diabetic patients."
[Diabetes in elderly: a tailored management],"In developed countries, 12-25 % of the aged population (>65 years old) have diabetes. Treatment of the old diabetic patients is less well studied compared to younger patients although diabetic and geriatric medical associations have issued specific treatment and priority guidelines for these patients. Treatment and targets of glycemic control must be adapted to the functional condition of the patients, prevent symptoms and complications of the geriatric syndrome. Prevention and screening of chronic complication of diabetes have to be integrated in the overall care of aged diabetic patients to optimize their quality of life and health state.",
